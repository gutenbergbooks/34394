<div class='unindent'>TO THE PUBLIC:&mdash;</div>

<p>In the elecution of its purpose to give educational value and
moral worth to the recreational activities of the boyhood of America,
the leaders of the Boy Scout Movement quickly learned that to effectively
carry out its program, the boy must be influenced not only in his out-of-door
life but also in the diversions of his other leisure moments.
It is at such times that the boy is captured by the tales of daring
enterprises and adventurous good times. What now is needful is not
that his taste should be thwarted but trained. There should constantly
be presented to him the books the boy likes best, yet always the books
that will be best for the boy. As a matter of fact, however, the boy's
taste is being constantly vitiated and exploited by the great mass of
cheap juvenile literature.</p>

<p>To help anxiously concerned parents and educators to meet this
grave peril, the Library Commission of the Boy Scouts of America has
been organized. EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY is the result of their labors.
All the books chosen have been approved by them. The Commission is
composed of the following members: George F. Bowerman, Librarian, Public
Library of the District of Columbia, Washington, D. C.; Harrison F.
Graver, Librarian, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Pa.; Claude G. Leland,
Superintendent, Bureau of Libraries, Board of Education, New York City;
Edward F. Stevens Librarian, Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn,
New York; together with the Editorial Board of our Movement, William
D. Murray, George D. Pratt and<a name="Frank_Presbrey" id="Frank_Presbrey"></a> Frank Presbrey, with Franklin K. Mathiews,
Chief Scout Librarian, as Secretary.</p>

<p>In selecting the books, the Commission has chosen only such as
are of interest to boys, the first twenty-five being either works of
fiction or stirring stories of adventurous experiences. In later lists,
books of a more serious sort will be included. It is hoped that as
many as twenty-five may be added to the Library each year.</p>

<p>Thanks are due the several publishers who have helped to
inaugurate this new department of our work. Without their co-operation
in making available for popular priced editions some of the best books
ever published for boys, the promotion of EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY would
have been impossible.</p>

<p>We wish, too, to express our heartiest gratitude to the Library
Commission, who, without compensation, have placed their vast experience
and immense resources at the service of our Movement.</p>

<p>The Commission invites suggestions as to future books to be
included in the Library. Librarians, teachers, parents, and all others
interested in welfare work for boys, can render a unique service by
forwarding to National Headquarters lists of such books as in their
Judgment would be suitable for EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"THE BAND" AND THE CAVE<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BLACKINTON'S barn is exactly at the foot
of Bob's Hill. Phillips's is, too, and so is
our garden; but I am not telling about those now.
Beyond the barns are apple orchards, reaching halfway
up the hill, as you know, if you have read about
the doings of the Band.</div>

<p>When they built Blackinton's barn they cut into
the hill, so that the roof of the stable slopes clear
down to the ground, on the hill side in the orchard.
It makes a fine place for us boys to sit and talk about
things.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blackinton, who owns the barn, says that
maybe climbing around on a roof isn't the best
thing in the world for shingles but boys have got
to do something and she is willing to take a chance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
only to be as careful as we can, and not to eat
any more apples than are necessary to our happiness
and well being.</p>

<p>Anyhow, seven of us Bob's Hill boys sat there
one Saturday afternoon in May, planning what to
do in the long vacation. Every member of the
Band was there, not counting Tom Chapin, except
Skinny Miller; and we were expecting him every
minute.</p>

<p>He was late then, and every little while one of
us would stick his head around the edge of the
barn to see if he wasn't coming up the driveway
from Park Street. We might as well have sat
still, for you never can tell which way he will
come.</p>

<p>Pa says that Skinny is like the wind, which
bloweth whither it listeth. I don't exactly know
what he meant but that is what he said, or something
like that.</p>

<p>It was quiet in the orchard. There was hardly
a sound except the buzzing of insects in the sunshine,
and somehow that only seemed to make it
more quiet and dreamy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Bill Wilson stood up on the sloping
shingles and gave such a warwhoop that it almost
made the bark rattle on the trees. When Bill turns
his voice loose it is something awful.</p>

<p>We looked up to see what it all was about. He
had grabbed Benny Wade by the hair and, giving
another yell louder than the first, was pretending
to scalp him. Bill always likes to play Indian.</p>

<p>Benny didn't want to be scalped. Although he
is two years younger and not nearly so big, he
grabbed Bill around the legs and held on until they
both slipped and went tumbling down the steep
roof to the ground, where they sat, with the rest
of us laughing down at them.</p>

<p>Just then we heard another warwhoop, sounding
from up the hill somewhere, beyond the orchard.
Bill and Benny scrambled to their feet, and we all
looked and listened.</p>

<p>We saw nothing for a minute or two. Then
something darted through the gate, which leads
into the orchard from the hill; dropped down out
of sight behind the fence, and commenced crawling
backward toward the nearest apple tree. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
few seconds, it would raise up long enough to point
something, which looked like a gun, at the enemy.</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" whispered Bill. "What's
that?"</p>

<p>But we could tell in a minute without asking,
for when it reached the tree it stood up and peered
around the trunk, aiming a stick and pretending to
fire. We knew then that Skinny was on the way.</p>

<p>"It's Skinny!" shouted Benny, throwing a stick
at him.</p>

<p>Skinny waved one arm for us to be quiet, then
began to wriggle back to the next tree. Making
his way slowly from tree to tree, with a quick dash
he finally reached the roof, where he felt safe.</p>

<p>"That was a close call, Skinny," said Bill. "I
heard a bee buzzin' around out there in the orchard,
a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Bee, nothin'!" Skinny told him, still pointing
with his gun and looking around in every direction.
"They pretty near had me surrounded."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of this history, which
tells all about the doings of the Band, that set all
the people talking about us for miles around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps you never heard about the Band; how
we found a cave at Peck's Falls, part way up the
mountain, and had all kinds of fun playing there
and on Bob's Hill. There are eight of us in all.
Skinny is captain. His folks call him Gabriel but
we don't like that name. Skinny is a good name
for him, he is so fat. He can run though, even
if he is heavy, and you would think that he could
fight some if you had seen him once, when the
Gingham Ground Gang got after us.</p>

<p>Benny Wade is the littlest fellow in the bunch
but he feels just as big as anybody and sometimes
that is almost as good as being big. Besides these
there are Harry, Wallie, Chuck, Bill Wilson, Hank
Bates,&mdash;Oh, yes, I most forgot,&mdash;and myself.</p>

<p>My name is John Alexander Smith. The boys
call me Pedro, and I have been secretary ever since
Tom Chapin found the cave. It's up to me to
write the doings of the Band and the minutes of
the meetings.</p>

<p>Tom Chapin was our first captain and he meets
with us now, whenever he is in town.</p>

<p>The village where we live is in a long, narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
valley, with little Hoosac River flowing north
through the center of it, until it gets beyond the
mountain range. Then it turns west and hurries
down into the Hudson.</p>

<p>Bob's Hill stands just west of the village and
looks down upon the highest steeples. Over the
brow of the hill and a little south are Plunkett's
woods. West, straight back, a mile or more, begins
the timbered slope of old Greylock, which, everybody
knows, is the highest mountain in Massachusetts.
And in the edge of the first woods, a
little back from the road, is the prettiest place you
ever sat eyes upon. Grown-up folks call it "the
glen," but we boys just say "Peck's Falls." I
don't know why, only there is a waterfall there,
which begins in a brook, somewhere up on the
mountainside, and plays and tumbles along, until
finally it pours down from a high cliff into a pool
a hundred feet below; then dashes off to join
Hoosac River.</p>

<p>A queer-shaped rock, with a high back and narrow
ledge, which we call the "pulpit," bridges the
ravine in front of the falls, fifty feet and maybe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
more, above the rushing water. A little farther
down the ravine, at the edge of the stream, is
another rock. It will do no harm now to say
that our cave is under that rock, because folks have
found out about it, although not many know about
there being two entrances.</p>

<p>All these things that I have told about belong
to us boys. Mr. Plunkett thinks that he owns
Plunkett's woods and Bob's Hill. I mean the very
top of it. And somebody has been cutting trees off
from Greylock, until it looks like a picked chicken
in spots. But we call them all ours because we
have more fun with them than anybody else does,
and it seems to us that things belong to those who
get the most out of them.</p>

<p>We knew from the way Skinny was acting that
he had something on his mind, so we sat down and
waited for him to tell us.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said he, after a while, "we've been
Injuns and we've been bandits, and we have had
fun, good and plenty. I ain't sayin' that Injuns
and bandits are not all right sometimes but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guess what!" broke in Benny. "We've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
'splorers, too. Don't you remember 'sploring out
in Illinois last summer? About LaSalle and that
other guy and What's-her-name who fell over the
cliff?"</p>

<p>"That was all right, too," said Skinny, "and
I couldn't forget it in a thousand years, but I tell
you those things are back numbers. They are out
of date."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the date," said Hank, "but
hurry and get it out of your system. We've got
to be something, haven't we? If we ain't Injuns
and we ain't bandits, what are we?"</p>

<p>"We are Scouts," shouted Skinny, aiming with
his gun and dodging so quickly that he almost slid
down the roof.</p>

<p>We all looked at one another in surprise, wondering
what he meant. Benny spoke up first.</p>

<p>"What are those things, Skinny?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why," said Skinny, "haven't you been readin'
about 'em? They are&mdash;er&mdash;they are&mdash;er&mdash;they're
just Scouts, that's all.&mdash;They scout around, you
know, and do all kinds of stunts."</p>

<p>"Scoot around, you mean," I told him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it's the same thing, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Not for mine," said Bill, shaking his head.
"Scouts may be all right, but Injuns and bandits
are good enough for me."</p>

<p>"Here's the book, anyhow," said Skinny.</p>

<p>He pulled out of his pocket a little book, which
told all about "The Boy Scouts of America."</p>

<p>"That's what we are going to be, the Boy Scouts
of America, or part of them. They have members
all over the country. We'll call ourselves 'The Boy
Scouts of Bob's Hill,' when we have our meetings."</p>

<p>Say, it looked good to the Band, except Bill,
after Skinny had read the book to us a little, sitting
there on the roof. It was a good deal like what
we had been doing, only more so. Even Bill said
it was almost as good as being Injuns and when
Benny heard about the uniforms he hardly could
wait.</p>

<p>"How are we going to do it?" I asked, after
we had talked until we were tired.</p>

<p>"That is what I came to tell you about," said
Skinny. "Mr. Norton, who teaches my class in
Sunday school, is getting one up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"One what, Skinny?" asked Benny, his eyes
bulging out like saucers, he was so interested.</p>

<p>"Something he called a 'patrol.' You see, the
Boy Scouts are almost like an army, with all kinds
of officers, only they call them different names, and
the different companies are called patrols. He is
getting up a patrol in the Sunday school and wanted
me in that, but when I told him about the Band
he said that we could have a patrol of our own,
if we wanted to. There are eight of us, you know,
and that is just enough. I don't know much about
it yet, but Mr. Norton wants me to bring the Band
up to his house Monday night and talk it over.
He's going to have ice cream; I heard him say so
to Mrs. Norton."</p>

<p>When he said that last, he looked at Bill, because
Bill liked ice cream, although he didn't seem to
think much of the Scout business.</p>

<p>"Will you go?" asked Skinny. "I've got to
tell him to-morrow, so he'll know how much ice
cream to make."</p>

<p>Benny looked at me and I could see by the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
his eyes were shining that he wanted to go. But
Bill never likes to change his mind.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to vote on it," he said, "and
have Pedro put it in the minutes of the meetin'."</p>

<p>"Shall I put it down in invisible ink," I asked,
"or in the kind that shows?"</p>

<p>We always write our most secret doings in
invisible ink, made of lemon juice, so that nobody
can read about them. We don't need to read it
ourselves, because we know all about it anyway. If
we want to, by holding the writing up to a fire we
can make the letters show.</p>

<p>"Write it with chalk," said Skinny, "and make
the letters a foot high. This is something we want
folks to know about."</p>

<p>"Uniforms wouldn't be so very much good," said
Benny, "if folks couldn't see us with them on."</p>

<p>Skinny nodded his head; then took a piece of
chalk out of his pocket, and commenced to mark
on the clapboards, back of the sloping roof.</p>

<p>I thought at first that he was going to write
the minutes of the meeting before it happened and
was going to kick about it, being secretary. Instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of that, however, he made a big circle, and in the
center of the circle he drew a picture of a tomahawk.
Then, after looking at a watch which his folks
gave him for Christmas, he put the figures 18 above
the tomahawk, and 16 below.</p>

<p>That was our Indian sign. The circle meant our
cave at Peck's Falls, that being sort of round. The
figures said for us to meet on the eighteenth day
of the month, at the sixteenth hour, which would
be at four o'clock that very afternoon. We had
half an hour in which to get to the cave.</p>

<p>When we saw the Sign we all gave a yell, Bill
Wilson louder than anybody, and were going to
start for the cave on a jump, but Skinny hissed
like a snake and held up one hand for us to keep
still.</p>

<p>"My braves," said he, after he had made up a
lot of Indian words, which we couldn't understand,
only they sounded fierce, "do you want to lose your
scalps? You don't know what is waitin' for us on
yonder hill."</p>

<p>We didn't, either. If we had, maybe we shouldn't
have gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/i003.png" width="377" height="500" alt="WITH SKINNY LEADING, WE STARTED, DODGING FROM TREE TO TREE." title="" />
<span class="caption">WITH SKINNY LEADING, WE STARTED, DODGING FROM TREE TO TREE.</span>
</div>

<p>"Follow me," said he. "Keep behind the trees
until we get out of the forest, and mum's the
word!"</p>

<p>So, with Skinny leading, we started, dodging
from tree to tree on the hillside, until we came to
the orchard fence. After that there were no trees
except on the very top.</p>

<p>There is a sort of road leading out of the orchard
and winding around the hill, where the walking is
easy, but on that side Bob's Hill itself rises almost
straight up from the orchards, and the slope
is covered with slippery grass, with now and
then a big stone sticking its nose out of the
ground. To climb it you have to dig in with
the sides and heels of your shoes and work
hard.</p>

<p>Skinny started straight up and we after him,
except Bill, who can climb faster than anybody.
He soon was ahead.</p>

<p>As Bill neared the top, forgetting all about
danger, Skinny gave a warning hiss. Bill looked
back; then dropped to the ground and began to
crawl slowly up, pulling at the grass and stones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to help him along. The rest of us waited to see
what would happen to Bill.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we saw him stick his head
up carefully above the brow of the hill. Then
he dodged down out of sight and slid back part
way toward us, motioning for us to come on and
not to make any noise.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to think of it, for I hadn't
really supposed anybody would be there. Skinny
is 'most always careful that way because, he says,
you never can tell what may happen.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said he, when Bill motioned. "Didn't
I tell you they pretty near had me surrounded?
Steady now, and mum's the word!"</p>

<p>Slowly we crawled up toward Bill. When we
had come up even with him, without a word he
crept toward the top of the hill, we crawling along
after him, and my heart was pounding like a trip-hammer,
partly from the work of climbing and
partly because it was scary.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we began to hear voices. The eight
of us put our heads up at about the same time;
then sank down again out of sight, and I heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Skinny whisper, "Jerusalem!" and Bill saying
"Great snakes!" to himself.</p>

<p>We lay there for a moment, looking at each
other and not knowing what to do. Then Benny
spoke up.</p>

<p>"Come on, fellers," said he. "Who's afraid
of them? It's only a lot of girls."</p>

<p>That's what it was. About twelve high-school
girls were sitting there under a tree, with lunch
baskets around, looking at Greylock and waiting
for it to be time to eat. There was no way for
us to pass without being seen except to go back
and around through Plunkett's woods, and we
didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>"Let's scare 'em," said Skinny at last. "We'll
yell the way we did on Greylock that time we scared
the wild cat."</p>

<p>"It's all right to scare 'em," said Hank, "for
they haven't any business on our hill. But a girl
ain't a wild cat or anything like it, and you never
can tell what she will do. They may not scare
worth a cent."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," I said. "If we all yell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
they'll know that it must be the Band. So let's
have only one yell. Give Bill a chance and there
will be something doing."</p>

<p>We left Bill and crawled up to where we could
see them and they couldn't see us. Then he commenced.</p>

<p>Say, I've heard Bill Wilson a lot of times, but I
never heard anything like that. Although I knew
what was doing it, shivers chased up and down
my back, until I 'most forgot about the girls.</p>

<p>He started with a moan like he was in pain.
Then for a minute it sounded as if a whole
menagerie had been turned loose, with a dog fight
in the middle. From the midst of the dog fight
came a blood-curdling screech which died away
again in a moan and sob, and then all was still
while Bill was getting his breath for another.</p>

<p>It was awful to hear, and the girls didn't wait
for another, or even for the sob part. At the
first moan they started to their feet, looking around
with scared faces, and when the menagerie turned
loose away they went on a run.</p>

<p>"Charge, my braves!" cried Skinny, as soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he could stop laughing long enough to speak.
"Let's surround 'em."</p>

<p>With a yell, we charged across the top of the
hill, down the slope beyond and into a field which
rose gently up to Plunkett's woods.</p>

<p>Just before the girls reached the woods one of
them looked back, saw us, and told the others. I
thought they would run harder than ever when
they saw us coming, but it was just as Hank said
about not knowing what they would do. They
turned and stood there, the whole twelve of them,
looking so mad that we stopped running and waited
to see what would happen.</p>

<p>"We know who you are, Skinny Miller," said
the one who had seen us first, "and you ought
to be ashamed of yourself. We'll fix you for
this."</p>

<p>She said something to the others, which we
couldn't hear, and pointed toward us. Then they
stooped and each one grabbed a stick from the edge
of the woods.</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill. "I wish I hadn't
come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fellers," said Skinny, looking at his watch.
"It's 'most four o'clock. We'll have to run like
sixty if we get to the cave in time for the meetin'."</p>

<p>There are a lot of boys who never saw a mountain,
and the Band, even, never saw the Rockies
and big mountains like those. But Greylock is big
enough for us. On a summer day, with fleecy
clouds chasing over his head like great, white butterflies;
sunshine resting on the pine trees, and the
mountain smiling down on us with arms outstretched,
as if he would gather in all of Massachusetts
and a part of Vermont, and the cawing
of crows in the Bellows Pipe, and no school to
call us back&mdash;say, that's living; that is!</p>

<p>Soon we came to the woods and followed along
a path until we could hear the rushing and roaring
of Peck's Falls in front of us, sounding as if old
Greylock himself was talking.</p>

<p>We stopped at Pulpit Rock a minute to see the
falls and the foaming pool below; then followed
Skinny down the side of the steep ravine to our
cave at the edge of the stream.</p>

<p>"The meetin' will come to order," said Skinny,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
after we had crawled in and were sitting on the
floor. "Are we all here?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Benny, "and I," "and I," "and
I," said the others, faster than I could count them.</p>

<p>"All the fellers that want to go to Mr. Norton's,"
said Skinny, as soon as he had found that everybody
was there, "to see about this Scout business&mdash;and
eat ice cream," he added, looking at Bill when
he said it, "mark a cross on the floor of the cave
with your knives."</p>

<p>Everybody marked except Bill. He didn't have
his knife with him.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said he. "I'll go, anyhow,
knife or no knife. I'd rather be an Injun than a
Scout any day in the week, but there ain't any use
letting that ice cream go to waste."</p>

<p>"'Tis well," said Skinny. "We have spoken."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RAVEN PATROL HITS THE TRAIL<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Monday night came, the Band met at
Skinny's and went from there to Mr. Norton's.
He seemed glad to see us and started in
for a good time without saying a word about the
Scout business. I was just going to ask him about
it when Mrs. Norton brought in the ice cream.
After that we were too busy to ask anything.</div>

<p>When at last we had eaten all that we wanted
and Bill had put away three dishes, Mr. Norton
gathered us around him and said that he would
tell us a story, if we wished to hear it.</p>

<p>We told him to go ahead, and, after thinking a
moment, he began.</p>

<p>"You boys probably do not remember the Boer
war in Africa. You were too young at the time.
During that war the Boers surrounded a town
called Mafeking. All the able-bodied men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
needed for fighting in order to defend the city
and could not be spared for the work of carrying
despatches and things like that.</p>

<p>"They had some lively lads in that town. As
soon as the boys found out the situation they made
up their minds that they could do that kind of
work just as well as the men could. They did,
too. Back and forth they hurried on bicycles,
through a rain of bullets, from fort to fort, carrying
messages and scouting. I tell you, those English
boys were heroes. I don't see how they escaped
being killed. They must have dodged the
bullets."</p>

<p>When Skinny heard Mr. Norton speak of their
being English boys he looked troubled, because
Skinny thinks a lot of the United States of America.</p>

<p>"Is this an English story, Mr. Norton?" he
asked. "Because if it is I don't know about it.
How about George Washington, Bunker Hill, seeing
the whites of the enemy's eyes, and all those
things? We named our boat out on Fox River
in Illinois, the 'Paul Revere.'"</p>

<p>"Guess what!" put in Benny, laughing at something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he was thinking. "Skinny couldn't dodge
any bullets? 'Cause why? He's too fat. They
couldn't miss him."</p>

<p>"Aw, what's the matter with you?" said Skinny.
"I could dodge as many as you could, I guess.
If a bullet hit you there wouldn't be anything left
of you; that's what. Why, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A hero is a hero," said Mr. Norton, before
Skinny had time to finish, "and a boy is a boy, I
guess, no matter in what country he happens to
live. I have heard all about the Band, and I know
that if you had been in Mafeking that time you
would have been among the first to volunteer for
scout service, bullets or no bullets, and Washington
or no Washington."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" yelled Bill, forgetting where he was.
"That's the stuff. Injun or no Injun, too. I
knew an English boy once, and he was all right.
Say, you ought to have seen him in a scrap."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton laughed and went on with his
story.</p>

<p>"A few years later Gen. Robert Baden-Powell,
who had been colonel in command of the English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
forces at Mafeking, got to thinking about those
boys in South Africa and how manly it made them
to help in the scouting. He liked boys and he
made up his mind that if scouting had been good
for those boys it would be good for any boys.
Not the fighting part, I mean, but the outdoor life,
learning to take care of themselves in the wilderness,
make camps, build fires, find their way
through the forest, follow a trail, and such things.
So he called a meeting of a lot of boys and talked
to them and showed them how to do it. They
played at being Indians mostly."</p>

<p>"They don't have Injuns in England," said Bill,
shaking his head, "unless it's in a Wild West show,
and that doesn't count."</p>

<p>"You are stopping the story, Bill," Skinny told
him. "What's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Well, they don't," grumbled Bill.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Mr. Norton went on, "the boys enjoyed
the play, and the idea spread like wildfire,
until now there are Boy Scouts all over the world.
In America here Ernest Thompson Seton had
much the same idea. He was teaching the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
woodcraft, camp life, and such things by organizing
the Seton Indians that you may have heard
about. Then he went to England, where he and
General Baden-Powell put their heads together and
worked out the Boy Scout idea. In this country
the boys are known as 'the Boy Scouts of America,'
but nearly every civilized nation has its Boy
Scouts under some name or other, and the movement
is very popular among the boys.</p>

<p>"I invited you up here to-night to get acquainted
with the Band. Skinny, I mean Gabriel, tells me
that you are all live wires. I want to know if
you will join the Scouts. You can have a patrol
of your own, select your own patrol leader and
your own patrol animal."</p>

<p>"What's a patrol animal?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Patrol animal? Why, each patrol is named
after some animal, and the Scouts all have to be
able to imitate its call, so that they can let each
other know where they are hiding."</p>

<p>When Mr. Norton told us that you hardly could
have heard yourself think for a minute. Mrs. Norton
didn't know what had broken loose and came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
running in from the next room. Skinny was
hissing like a snake; Bill croaked like a frog; Benny
cawed like a crow; Hank barked like a dog, and
the other boys did something else, and nobody
could tell what they were doing.</p>

<p>"You seem to have the right idea," smiled Mr.
Norton.</p>

<p>There was a lot more to it, uniforms and rules
and signs and all that sort of thing, but that doesn't
belong in this history. It didn't take us long to
decide that we would go in. Bill Wilson was the
craziest one in the bunch.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton thought that we ought to decide on
a patrol leader before we went home. We told
him that there was nothing to decide.</p>

<p>"Skinny is captain, all right," said Benny, "and
the Band is the Band, I guess, whether we are
Scouts or Injuns."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm captain of the Band," Skinny told
him, when Mr. Norton waited to see what he had
to say about it, "but I don't know about this patrol
business. It wouldn't do to vote on it here, anyway.
The cave is where we meet. We ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
vote in the cave, seeing it is summer time. If it
was winter we could meet in Pedro's barn."</p>

<p>We left it that way and were so busy during the
closing days of school that we didn't have time
to think much more about it until Friday. When
we came in from afternoon recess, there was the
Sign, as big as life, drawn with chalk on the blackboard.</p>

<p>I saw teacher looking at it, sort of puzzled, as
if she was wondering what it all was about, and
some of the girls were giggling at it. They seemed
to think it was a joke of some kind, instead of
something important. Anyhow, the Sign said for
us to meet at the cave, Saturday, at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, long before ten, every boy
was at our house, that being nearest to the cave.
Each one carried a lot of good things to eat, so
we should not have to go home for dinner unless
we wanted to.</p>

<p>Besides his dinner Hank had with him a little
camera, which his folks had given to him on his
birthday because he promised not to make any
more awful smells with chemicals in the cellar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Hank was always mixing things to see what would
happen and he pretty near blew his house up at
one time. He is an inventor, too, and says that
when he grows up he is going to make a flying
machine. He nearly made one once. He made a
kite that would pull us uphill on our sleds.</p>

<p>One time he made a spanking machine which
worked with a crank, and when teacher wanted us
to lick Bill we spanked him with it. Only we laid
a horse hair across the seat of his pants to see
what it would do and it broke the machine. Of
course, he didn't make the camera, but he had a
place down cellar where he developed and printed
his pictures after the camera had taken them.</p>

<p>"Gee, fellers," said Skinny, "Hank is goin' to
take our pictures. Everybody look pleasant."</p>

<p>"Not on your life," Hank told him. "You'd
break the machine; that's what."</p>

<p>We went up through Blackinton's orchard and
followed the road around to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>In a field, a little west of the top, the same field
where we chased the high-school girls, stand what
we call the "twin stones." They are big ones, six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
feet high and maybe more. One of these we use
for a fireplace. It is near Plunkett's woods, where
it is always easy to find dry sticks to burn. A piece
of the rock has been split off in such a way that it
makes a kind of hearth, with a place between for
a fire.</p>

<p>"Let's come back here for dinner," I said.
"When we build a fire in the cave the smoke makes
our eyes smart. What do you say?"</p>

<p>So we went into the woods and hid our lunch
and some potatoes, which we had carried in our
pockets to cook, but Hank wouldn't leave his
camera. He said it cost too much to let it lie
around in the woods. His folks paid three dollars
for it.</p>

<p>Then we hurried on to the cave.</p>

<p>"Open sesame!" said Skinny, pounding the outside
of the cave with a club, like the robber did
in "Arabian Nights."</p>

<p>"Is she open?" asked Bill, who was in a hurry
to get in.</p>

<p>Skinny didn't answer. He was peering up and
down the ravine to see if anybody was looking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
When he found that no one was in sight he motioned
for us to go in.</p>

<p>"Old Long Knife will guard the pass," said he.</p>

<p>And he did, for when I put my head out of the
cave a little later to find out why he did not come,
he was fighting like sixty. He swung his club and
jumped around for a minute; then gave a fearful
whack and drew himself up with his arms folded,
like an Injun or a bandit.</p>

<p>"Lie there, villain!" he hissed. "Sick semper
turn us, and don't you forget it."</p>

<p>After that he came in with his face all red,
he had been working so hard. We already had the
candle lighted and were ready to begin.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said Skinny, when we all had sat down
on the floor in front of him and I had called the
roll. "I don't know whether this is the Band or
the patrol, or whether we are bandits, or Injuns,
or Scouts, and I don't know that it makes much
difference. I am captain of the Band, but what
we want to find out is, who is leader of the patrol.
We could fight for it, perhaps, only I hate to muss
my clothes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Some looked at Bill, for we knew that he kind
of wanted to be leader. He would make a good
one, too, only it seemed to belong to Skinny.</p>

<p>Nobody said a thing for 'most a minute. Then
Benny stood up, bumped his head against the roof
of the cave, and sat down again.</p>

<p>"Mighty chief," said he, when we were through
laughing at him, "may I speak and live?"</p>

<p>He never had said that before and it surprised
us.</p>

<p>"You may," said Skinny, looking fierce and
swinging his club.</p>

<p>"Fellers," began Benny, "Skinny was a good
enough leader when we went 'sploring out in Illinois
last summer and I 'most got drowned in Fox River,
and he was a good enough leader when we found
a tramp in this 'ere cave and smoked him out. He
lassoed the robber, that time, didn't he, when the
guy was stealin' Hank's pearl, and&mdash;and&mdash;lots of
things? I guess that anybody who could do that
is good enough to be patrol leader."</p>

<p>That was a long speech for Benny to make, and
we all patted him on the back except Bill, who sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
thinking and getting ready to say something. All
of a sudden he spoke up.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said he, "three cheers for Skinny
Miller, who is always there with the goods."</p>

<p>"You're out of order," Skinny told him, but
nobody could hear.</p>

<p>I shouldn't wonder if they heard us voting clear
down in the village.</p>

<p>We also had to have an assistant patrol leader,
called a corporal, and we elected Bill Wilson. Bill
is great at such things. As corporal he would be
in command whenever Skinny was away. That
didn't count for much, though, for Skinny
is almost always around when anything is
going on.</p>

<p>The next thing to do was to decide upon our
patrol animal, like the book said.</p>

<p>At first we couldn't agree very well on that.
Nearly every one wanted a different animal.
Skinny wanted us to choose a snake because he
liked the hissing part and a picture of a snake would
be easy to draw on our signs.</p>

<p>Hank and Bill thought a dog would be best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dog," said Bill, "is man's best friend, and
that is what Scouts are for."</p>

<p>Hank could bark like a dog. That was why he
wanted it.</p>

<p>Benny thought a crow would be the thing, but
it seemed to me that the American eagle would
be better. We heard one once on Greylock and
it was great.</p>

<p>Skinny liked the eagle pretty well, especially the
American part, but when he found that Benny
Wade wanted a crow he said he was for a crow,
too. That was because Benny had made the
speech.</p>

<p>"A snake is all right for some things," he said,
"and you don't want to step on them or on us.
Don't you remember that old flag which had a
rattlesnake on it and the words, 'Don't tread on
me'? The hissing is all right, too, when we are
close together and can hear, but how about it
when we are not? What if I was hiding in
Plunkett's woods and you were on the way to the
cave and I should be attacked by Injuns or something.
I might hiss until I was black in the face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and who'd hear me? You could hear me caw almost
to Peck's Falls."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so about snakes," I told them. "I
don't think much of snakes myself. But I don't
know about crows. The eagle is such a noble
bird."</p>

<p>"Noble nothin'!" said he. "What did an eagle
ever do that was noble any more than a crow? Besides
a crow can talk if you split its tongue. I
read it in a book. You can't draw an eagle. You'd
have to write under it what it was."</p>

<p>"So you would under a crow," I told him.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he went on, "I'll bet nobody here
can make a noise like an eagle. Let's hear you
do it, Pedro. Cawing is easy."</p>

<p>That ended the eagle business. Skinny was
right. Not one of us could make a noise like an
eagle.</p>

<p>"What makes you want it a crow, Benny?"
asked Hank.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to tell it," said Benny, sort
of bashful like. "I wasn't thinking about drawing
it. A crow would be hard to draw, I guess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but we could make something that looked like a
bird and we boys would know what bird was meant.
I wasn't thinking either whether it was noble or
not. Maybe a crow ain't exactly noble, but somehow
when I see a big fellow soaring around in the
Bellows Pipe, between the mountains, it makes me
feel kind of noble myself and as if I ought to soar,
too. And when I hear the cawing of a crow, no
matter where I am, even in North Adams or Pittsfield,
I can see Bob's Hill and old Greylock and
the Bellows Pipe, and big crows flying around in
the air as if they owned them all. We are Bob's
Hill boys and Greylock boys. That's why I want
it a crow. They sort of belong together."</p>

<p>We never had thought of that before, but when
we came to talk it over it seemed that way to us,
too. So we chose the crow for our patrol animal,
only we didn't call ourselves "the crows" but "the
ravens," because it sounded so much nobler. While
we can't draw a very good one when we make our
signs, it looks some like a bird and we all know
what kind it is, as Benny said.</p>

<p>By that time we were getting hungry and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
we made a bee-line for Plunkett's woods, sounding
as if a whole flock of crows were starting south.</p>

<p>"Everybody scatter for wood," shouted Skinny,
when we had come to the big stone where we build
our fires. "I'll get the grub."</p>

<p>We ran to different parts of the woods where
we knew there were dead branches lying on the
ground, trying to see which would get a fire going
first. Then, just as Bill and I met at the stone,
with arms full of sticks, and the others close behind,
we heard a terrible cawing over in the woods,
only it didn't sound so much like a crow as it did
like Skinny.</p>

<p>We looked at one another, wondering what it all
meant, for the Scout business was new to us. Besides
it sounded as if something had happened.</p>

<p>"'Tention, Scouts," said Bill, in a hurry to get
in his work as corporal while Skinny was away.
"Everybody caw!"</p>

<p>We made a great racket. In a moment there
came an answering caw from the woods; then
Skinny stepped out into the clearing in plain sight
and motioned for us to come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>We knew something was the matter and started
for the woods on a jump, the corporal in the lead.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" shouted Skinny, when we had
come near. "Some guy has stolen our dinner."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" groaned Bill. "And I'm
starving to death."</p>

<p>We all gathered around the place where we had
hidden the things under some bushes. Skinny was
right; they were gone. I tell you he was mad.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we are Scouts or bandits
or Injuns," said he, "and I don't care, but I'd like
to get hold of the critter that stole our dinner.
We wouldn't do a thing to him. Oh, no. Maybe
not."</p>

<p>"Everybody scatter," he shouted. "Look for
signs and tracks. We'll follow him to the ends of
the earth."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TRACKING THE ROBBERS<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WE didn't have any idea who took our things
and there didn't seem to be any way of
finding out. The ground in the woods was carpeted
with pine needles, which left no trace of
footprints.</div>

<p>We thought that maybe those girls that we had
chased had taken our dinner to get even, and it
might have been the Summer Street boys, or maybe
the Gingham Ground Gang.</p>

<p>We scattered, like Skinny told us, and gradually
worked out from the center, crawling on our hands
and knees, and watching every inch of the ground
and the bushes.</p>

<p>We didn't get any trace at all until I found a
potato. Then Skinny, who was a little ahead of
me and at one side, gave a groan and yelled:</p>

<p>"Here's my wishbone. They've eaten all my
fried chicken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>It always makes Skinny mad to have somebody
eat his fried chicken.</p>

<p>Farther on we found pieces of eggshell and
then more, as if somebody had peeled an egg while
walking and thrown the shells on the ground.</p>

<p>We knew then that there was no chance of getting
our dinners back, but we followed the trail,
just the same.</p>

<p>After a time we came to the queerest looking
tracks, where somebody had stepped on a soft piece
of ground. Benny found them first.</p>

<p>"The spoor!" he yelled. "The spoor! I've
found the spoor."</p>

<p>"Well, don't tell the whole town about it," said
Skinny. "Keep quiet and we'll surround 'em."</p>

<p>"But the chicken and eggs are gone," he added,
after a moment. "I was going to give you some
of that chicken, Bill."</p>

<p>We stopped and had a long look at the tracks.
There were four footprints and a hole, which
looked as if it had been made with a stick, or cane.
Three of the prints were like those which any
man would make in walking and one was the print<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a bare foot, only it had a queer look that we
couldn't understand.</p>

<p>"We've got 'em," whispered Skinny. "We'll
know that footprint again anywhere we find it.
Forward, and mum's the word!"</p>

<p>Twice after that we found the same queer footprint;
once in the dust of a road that runs along
the south side of Plunkett's woods, and again on
the edge of a brook which comes down from the
mountain somewhere.</p>

<p>Then we lost the trail and didn't know where
to go. Just because we didn't know what else to
do, we followed the brook up, until we came to a
gully out of sight from the road.</p>

<p>Skinny was ahead, aiming with his stick and
saying what he would do if he should catch the
fellow that stole his chicken. All of a sudden we
saw him drop behind a bush and lie still. We
dropped, too. We didn't know what for, but I've
noticed that it is 'most always a good thing to drop
first and find out why afterward. Then we crawled
slowly up to him to see what had happened.</p>

<p>There, sitting on the ground in a grassy ravine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
near the brook, were two men, and they were eating
what remained of our lunch. One of them
had his left shoe off and his foot done up in a
bandage. That was what had made the track look
so queer.</p>

<p>Now that we had caught them we didn't know
what to do with them, for they were too big for
us to tackle.</p>

<p>"I believe we could get away with the lame one,"
whispered Skinny, "only they have about eaten it
all up; so what's the use? Besides, the other one
looks as big as a house."</p>

<p>"If we only had a rope, Skinny," said Benny,
"you could creep up behind and lasso them, the
same as you did the robber out near Starved Rock."</p>

<p>"Bet your life I could," he replied, "but we
haven't got one. Fellers, don't you ever go out
again without a rope. You can't ever tell when
you will need it."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill, thinking of the
chicken Skinny had been going to give him. "I'm
starving to death. Let's heave some rocks at 'em,
anyhow, and then run."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He picked up a big stone as he spoke and was
going to throw it, when Hank caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait," said he. "I know a trick worth two
of that. I'm going to shoot 'em."</p>

<p>"Shoot them?" I gasped in surprise. "What
with?"</p>

<p>"With my camera. You fellows stay here out
of sight and caw like a crow if they make any
move before I am ready for them. If I can only
get behind that clump of bushes back of them without
their seeing me, I'll take their picture."</p>

<p>"Aw, cut it out," said Bill.</p>

<p>But Hank was gone, and after a little we could
see him running through a field out of sight of
the men, so as to come into the ravine from the
other end. Pretty soon we saw him crawling in,
creeping from bush to bush, in sight only for a
second at a time.</p>

<p>There was not a sound except the voices of the
men, who were talking about something, and the
ground might have opened and swallowed Hank
for all we could see of him.</p>

<p>We waited a long time and began to get nervous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
not knowing what had happened, and I saw Bill
feeling around for another stone.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden Hank stood up above the
bushes he had told us about. He looked toward
where he knew we were hiding and put one finger
to his lips. Then he tossed a stone toward the
men and dropped down out of sight again before
it could fall.</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" whispered Bill. "If he's goin'
to throw, why don't he do it, and not give a baby
toss like that?"</p>

<p>Skinny held up one hand warningly as the pebble
fell into the brook right back of the men, making
a little splash and gurgle, as if a frog, or maybe
a trout, had leaped out after a fly.</p>

<p>When they heard it both men jumped up and
stood there in the sunshine, looking toward the
sound. We couldn't see Hank, but knew that he
was somewhere in the bushes taking their picture.</p>

<p>You almost could have heard our hearts beat
for a minute, not knowing what would happen.
Then the men sat down again and went on talking.</p>

<p>We waited five minutes to give Hank a chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to get away, and crawled back the way we had
come. When we reached the road we heard a crow
cawing in the woods and knew that he was safe.</p>

<p>"You answer, Benny," said Skinny. "You do
it best."</p>

<p>He gave three caws so real that I almost thought
it was a sure enough crow. Hank joined us and
we hurried down the road toward home, hoping
that the dinner would not be all eaten up.</p>

<p>"Did you get the picture?" I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I think so, but I can't be sure
until it has been developed. I had a splendid
chance. They stood just right and there was a
fine opening through the bushes."</p>

<p>"It took you a long time," grumbled Bill. "I
could have hit them with a rock easy."</p>

<p>"I was trying to hear what they were saying.
I couldn't hear very well, but I think they are
robbers or something."</p>

<p>"You bet they are robbers," said Skinny.
"Didn't they steal my fried chicken?"</p>

<p>We didn't think much more about the men because
we had important work on hand. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
thing we had to do was to eat dinner. That is
always important, especially when your mother
knows how to cook beefsteak that makes you crazy
just to smell. After that came a ball game. Our
nine, the "Invincibles," played a picked nine from
Summer Street. We beat, 25 to 19.</p>

<p>I didn't see any of the boys again until in
church, Sunday morning. When I went in Bill
Wilson was there, looking so dressed up that I
hardly knew him.</p>

<p>He saw me and motioned for me to come into
his pew, but Ma wouldn't let me do it. Bill had
something on his mind. It was easy to tell that.
He looked excited, and every time I turned around
he went through with all sorts of motions with
his mouth, trying to make me understand what he
wanted to say.</p>

<p>It bothered me. Every time the minister twisted
up his face, trying to make us understand how important
it was what he was saying, I'd think of
Bill's mouth going back of me. I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>When at last we went into Sunday school he
told me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great snakes, Pedro!" said he, grabbing me by
one arm. "Haven't you heard about it?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell whether I have or not, when I
don't know what it is?" I told him.</p>

<p>"They robbed Green's store last night; stole him
blind."</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"The guys that we saw yesterday. Our robbers."</p>

<p>When Bill told me that you could have knocked
me down with a feather. It made me almost as
excited as he was. He didn't have time to say any
more because teacher made him sit at the end of
the line away from me so that he wouldn't whisper
so much.</p>

<p>But after Sunday school was over he told me
all about it. Burglars had broken into Green's
store during the night. They blew open the safe
and took all the money, nearly one hundred dollars,
and they carried off a lot of knives and revolvers.
There is an alley back of the store. They
broke into the basement from there and then made
their way upstairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know that it was our robbers
who did it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Bill drew himself up and swelled out his chest,
just like Skinny does sometimes.</p>

<p>"I'm a Boy Scout, ain't I?" he said. "A corporal,
too."</p>

<p>"You are only a Tenderfoot," I told him.</p>

<p>That was true. You have to be a Tenderfoot
before you can get to be a real Scout.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," he said, winking one eye.
"One of the robbers has a tender foot, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Look here, Bill," I told him. "You are getting
to be worse than Skinny. What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Pedro," he said, "you'll never make a Scout.
You're a good bandit and a good secretary, but
this Scout business is too much for you. I saw
their tracks; that's what."</p>

<p>"In the alley?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Come on and I'll show you."</p>

<p>We hurried down to Center Street and turned
into the alley back of the stores. The ground in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the alley was hard and didn't show any tracks except
wagon ruts.</p>

<p>Bill looked up and down the alley to make sure
that nobody was watching; then tiptoed over to one
side, and lifted up a big piece of wrapping paper,
which lay there as if it had been blown out of the
store. Under the paper there was the same kind of
footprint which we had followed from Plunkett's
woods the day before.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. The man with a
bandaged foot must have been in the alley back of
the store which had been robbed.</p>

<p>Bill was the proudest fellow you ever saw over
that footprint. When I had finished looking at it
he put the paper back again and we went out into
the street.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" said he. "I
guess Skinny ain't the whole thing&mdash;on Sundays."</p>

<p>"Does the marshal know?"</p>

<p>"I haven't told a soul except you, Pedro. I
am saving it for the Band&mdash;I mean the patrol.
This is our chance. What's the good of bein' a
Scout if you don't do any scoutin'?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, I think we ought to tell the marshal
about this," I said. "Those robbers are not going
to wait for the Scouts to get busy. They probably
jumped a freight last night and are in New
York by this time. But maybe the marshal could
do something."</p>

<p>Bill was bound to tell the other Scouts about
it first. So after dinner we got the boys together
and all went over and took a look at the footprint.</p>

<p>Skinny was even more excited than Bill was.</p>

<p>"We are hot on the trail, fellers," said he.
"The thing to do is to surround them. We ought
to have captured them yesterday. Bet your life
we'll take a rope next time."</p>

<p>But when Pa found us talking it over on our
woodpile, and we told him about it, he said for
us to go to the marshal's at once, and if we didn't
he would.</p>

<p>It being Sunday, we went to the marshal's house
and found him sitting on the front porch dressed
in his best clothes. He was some surprised when
he saw the eight of us walk into his yard. It made
us wish that we had uniforms on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"To what do I owe the honor of this visit?"
said he. "Is this a committee of distinguished
citizens to ask me to run for mayor or something?"</p>

<p>Bill was bursting with the news, but Skinny was
the first to speak.</p>

<p>"We want you to run for those burglars," he
said, "and we can tell you who they are."</p>

<p>When he heard that the marshal began to get
interested.</p>

<p>"Well, who were they? Maybe," he went on,
smiling at us, "you youngsters have come to give
yourselves up."</p>

<p>"We didn't do it," put in Bill. "We wouldn't
do such a thing, but we know who did. We don't
know his name, but we know his track. We could
have caught him yesterday if we'd wanted to. I
wish we had now."</p>

<p>Then we told him about losing our dinners and
following the robbers through Plunkett's woods,
and about the queer looking track made by the
bandaged foot.</p>

<p>"I'd know that footprint in China," said Bill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"and I found one just like it in the alley back of
Green's store. The man with the lame foot made
it. I 'most know he did."</p>

<p>"Say, William, you are a regular sleuth," said
the marshal. "I have a notion to put you on the
force."</p>

<p>But he didn't guy us any more after that. He
put on his coat and walked downtown with us.</p>

<p>After he had looked at the footprint he covered
it up again so that nobody would step on it.</p>

<p>"That's the one all right," Hank told him.
"There were two of them. I heard them say
something about robbing, when I was taking their
pictures."</p>

<p>"Taking their pictures! They don't go around
breaking into stores with an official photographer
along, do they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what they go around with," Hank
said, "but I crept up close behind them and lay
back of a bush where I could hear them talking,
although I couldn't understand much of what they
said. I thought it would be fun to take their pictures
when they didn't know anything about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"They stood up when Hank threw a stone and
looked right at the camera, only they didn't know
it was there," Benny explained.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, boy! Do you mean to tell me that
you took a photograph of the rascals?"</p>

<p>"I snapped them all right," Hank told him, "but
I won't know whether I got a good picture or not
until I develop the roll. I haven't done it yet."</p>

<p>"Well, you develop it right away, or, better still,
get your camera and we'll have Marsh, the photographer,
do it and make sure of things. He'll
do it, if it is Sunday."</p>

<p>Hank hung back. "Can't you wait a while?"
he asked. "I've got five shots left in the camera
and don't want to waste them. They cost money."</p>

<p>The marshal looked disgusted. "Waste them!
How much did they cost?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents a roll; six in a roll."</p>

<p>The marshal pulled a quarter out of his pocket
and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"You'll be a rich man some day," said he.
"Now that roll of films belongs to me and that
picture is going to be developed before you are an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hour older. Can you do the job or shall I look
up Marsh?"</p>

<p>"I can do it all right, if there is any picture
to develop."</p>

<p>"Very well, go ahead with it and bring it down
to my office just as soon as you can. And I'll tell
you further, young fellow, if we catch those burglars
through your help, you'll get part of the reward."</p>

<p>Hank looked at us a moment with his eyes
shining. Then he drew himself up.</p>

<p>"I'm a Scout," said he, "and Scouts are not
looking for rewards. 'A Scout's duty is to be
useful and to help others.' The book says so."</p>

<p>It made us all feel proud to have Hank say
that. The marshal gave a surprised whistle.</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said he, laughing, "give
me back my quarter."</p>

<p>But Hank wouldn't do that, although Skinny
nudged him. I don't suppose you can learn to be
a Scout all at once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"DANGER&mdash;COME"<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IT was anxious work, standing around while
Hank ran the film from his camera through
some kind of machine which he had, to bring out
the picture. After what seemed like a long time
he took it out and looked through it toward the
light.</div>

<p>"Hurrah!" he yelled. "We've got 'em."</p>

<p>We all crowded around to look, and sure enough
at one end of the film we could see as plain as day
two men standing up and looking toward us. And
there was the brook, too, and the ravine, so real
that we almost could hear the water pouring over
the stones, which we think is the sweetest music
in the whole world. Away back in the picture was
the bush, behind which we boys were hiding when
Hank took it. Only you couldn't see us at all,
for we had been careful to keep out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>It is wonderful, isn't it? I don't know how it
is done and I don't believe that anybody else knows,
but I know that it is so because I saw it with my
own eyes.</p>

<p>Hank washed the film, and after it was dry put
it in a frame with some paper which he had, and
held it up to the gas jet. In a few seconds the
picture showed up on the paper fine, just like our
writing does when we do it in invisible ink and
hold it up to a blaze.</p>

<p>We could tell who it was, all right. The big
one had a scowl on his face, as if he had put it
there when Hank tossed the stone and hadn't had
time to smooth it out again.</p>

<p>"This picture is for the marshal," Hank told us.
"Now I'll print another for the patrol. We'll let
them soak and wash a while, and then dry them
out. It'll take quite a long time, but we've got 'em
all right."</p>

<p>When we finally went down to the marshal's it
was evening. He was tickled when he saw the
picture. It made Skinny feel real chesty and we
all of us were proud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, Mr. Michael," said he, "the Band's
the stuff. I mean the patrol is. They don't get
away from us very often. I only wish we'd had a
rope with us that time."</p>

<p>"You boys certainly did the trick," said the
marshal, examining the picture. "I don't know
those men myself, but I know where they will
know them, and that is the next best thing.
That is, if they are old crooks, as I suspect they
are."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked Skinny.</p>

<p>"At police headquarters in New York. They
have a rogues' gallery there that would surprise
you. It contains the pictures and records of nearly
every crook in the country. If these men are
among them they'll pretty near know where to put
their hands on them. I'll mail this down to-night.
I've telegraphed already. Come around to-morrow
and I'll tell you if I hear anything."</p>

<p>He met us with a broad grin the next afternoon
and showed us a telegram. This is what it said,
for I put it down. Skinny thought it ought to be
in the minutes of the meeting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men well-known crooks. Are under arrest.
Got the goods and most of the money."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"More than ten words are in that telegram,"
said Hank, counting them.</p>

<p>"There you go again," laughed the marshal.
"I'll have to call the New York chief down for
being so careless. Anyhow, your robbers will go
to the penitentiary as sure as preaching."</p>

<p>"I don't know about it," Benny told us afterward,
when we were talking it over. "I'm 'most
sorry that we did it. I shall always be thinking
that if it hadn't been for us those men wouldn't
be locked up away from birds and grass and trees.
Maybe they didn't have such good folks as we've
got. You know that guy out in Illinois didn't
have."</p>

<p>But after we saw Pa we felt better about it.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you feel that way," said he. "Still
you did the right thing after you found out about
the robbery. I wouldn't advise you, however, to
go around taking photographs of burglars. You
might get into trouble another time. It surely is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
an awful thing to be in state's prison, but being
away from the trees and grass is not the worst thing
about it. The worst thing is being so bad that
you have to be locked up in order to make other
people safe. It is a terrible thing to be a criminal,
whether you are in prison or not."</p>

<p>He was quiet for a minute; then went on:</p>

<p>"I can't think of a worse prison for a human
soul than a human body that does mean things,
lies and steals or is vile in any way."</p>

<p>A few days later when Skinny and I went to the
post-office together the postmaster handed him a
letter.</p>

<p>"I say," said he, "you have been promoted,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>On the envelope was written, "Captain Gabriel
Miller, Patrol Leader, Raven Patrol, Boy Scouts
of America."</p>

<p>It made us both excited.</p>

<p>"It's for the whole patrol," said Skinny, trying
to look through it. "I don't think I ought to
open it until we are all together, and I hardly can
wait."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He rushed to the door as he spoke and whistled
through his teeth, for he saw Bill and Hank passing
on the other side of the street, going to my house.</p>

<p>"I could have cawed," he explained when they
had come across, "but I didn't think that I ought
to when folks were looking."</p>

<p>We went over to Benny's and found him piling
wood and glad enough to quit.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the other boys," I told them.
"They will be along pretty soon. Whatever it is,
we'll want to read it twice, anyhow."</p>

<p>Skinny opened the letter and looked at the
writing.</p>

<p>"Jee-rusalem, fellers!" he shouted. Then he
commenced to caw like some crow that was crazy
with the heat.</p>

<p>Bill cawed, too, but he didn't know what for.
Then he tried to snatch the letter out of Skinny's
hand.</p>

<p>"Aw, cut it out, can't you?" said he, when
Skinny dodged out of the way. "Read it."</p>

<p>"I am readin' it," said Skinny. "It's great."</p>

<p>"Well, read it out loud."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Skinny started to read, and this is what the
letter said, only it doesn't tell how Skinny's eyes
shone, nor how he stopped every few lines to punch
the enemy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<i>To the Boy Scouts of Bob's Hill:</i>

<p>"I want to thank every boy in Raven Patrol,
and especially Henry Bates, for the recovery of
my property. But for you I should never have
seen it again and the burglars would still be at
large. I offered a reward for the capture of the
thieves and it rightfully belongs to you, but the
marshal has told me that, being Boy Scouts, you
do not want to be rewarded for good deeds. What
I wish to say is this: I like the Boy Scout idea and
want to help it along. Not as a reward but just
because I like boys, will you let me buy uniforms
for your patrol?</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Sincerely your friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Robert Green</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>That is how we happen to have such fine uniforms
that make folks turn around and look every
time we pass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day we first wore the uniforms we were
made real Scouts; not First class ones but Second
class. You see, there are three kinds. First you
have to be a Tenderfoot. That doesn't mean that
your feet are tender, but that you are new to the
business. To get to be a Second Class Scout, you
have to do all kinds of stunts and you have to be
a Tenderfoot at least a month.</p>

<p>We knew how to build fires and cook things out
in the woods and things like that, which Scouts
have to do, and the way we tracked the burglars
showed that we knew something about that.</p>

<p>The hardest things we had to do were to learn
the Morse alphabet of dots and dashes for signaling
and to learn what to do when folks get hurt,
how to put on bandages and things like that and
how to bring folks back to life when they are nearly
drowned. We learned them all right, and it is a
good thing we did.</p>

<p>Signaling was the most fun of all. We could
do it with flags like they do in the army; by waving
our arms like a semaphore, and by smoke from
fires like the Indians do. We also could spell out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
things with smoke in the Morse alphabet, which
was something the Indians couldn't do, by making
the smoke go up in puffs like dots and dashes.</p>

<p>Part of us would go up on Bob's Hill and part
on the hill opposite, beyond the Basin where we go
swimming, build fires, and signal to each other. It
was hard at first, but after a while we could spell
out 'most anything and understand some of it.</p>

<p>It came in handy, too, because one afternoon,
after we had been playing in our yard, we decided
to practise our signaling. Just after all the boys
had started for the east hill, except Skinny and me,
who were going up on Bob's Hill, Ma came out
and wanted to know where the other boys were.</p>

<p>"It is too bad that they have gone," said she.
"I was going to ask them to stay to supper."</p>

<p>"Maybe they'll come back," said Skinny, winking
at me.</p>

<p>"We are not going to have much, but I thought
you boys would enjoy eating together and we
should like it, too. We do not often have the
honor of sitting down to the table with young
gentlemen who have uniforms on."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll stay," said Skinny, "if you will let us
do something to help. According to Scout law, a
Scout must try his best to do somebody a good
turn every day. I haven't done it now for 'most
two days."</p>

<p>"If that is the case," Ma told him, "my woodbox
seems to be getting empty."</p>

<p>That is the greatest woodbox I ever saw for
getting empty. We filled it so full that the wood
fell off all over the floor; then started for the hill.</p>

<p>"Now is our chance," said Skinny. "We've
just got to make them understand this time. We
never have had anything much to tell the boys
before, but this is important."</p>

<p>We climbed to the very top of Bob's Hill and
soon had a fire going. When it was well started
we threw on some green stuff that made a big
smoke. Pretty soon we saw smoke going up across
the valley and knew that the other boys were ready.</p>

<p>"They are there," I said. "Now we'll tell
them."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Skinny. "First let's give the
danger signal. That'll fetch 'em."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there ain't any danger," I told him.
"What's the use of lying, even with smoke?"</p>

<p>"You bet there's danger," said he. "There's
danger of losing your mother's supper, ain't
there?"</p>

<p>So I gave him one end of a wet blanket which
I was carrying, and I grabbed hold of the other
end. We covered the fire with it, stopping all of
the smoke; then took it off and let a big puff go
up; then covered it again and sent up a little puff,
and kept doing that until I was sure the boys would
be most crazy, for that sign means danger.</p>

<p>After we had done it a while, we spelled out the
word "come." We did that by using the blanket
to make a short puff of smoke for a dot and a long
puff for a dash, like this:</p>

<div class='center'>
... C .. O &mdash; M . E<br />
</div>

<p>We waited and spelled it out twice more to make
sure, and then went down the hill to the house.</p>

<p>"Shall I set the table for the others?" Ma
asked, when she saw us coming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will be here in a few minutes," said
Skinny, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>We were not sure of it, but we hoped they would
and, as Skinny said, it wouldn't do any hurt to get
the table ready.</p>

<p>We were beginning to be afraid that they had
not understood and were not coming, when we
heard a faint cawing, a long way off somewhere.
It seemed from beyond Summer Street.</p>

<p>Skinny answered, while I ran into the house to
tell the folks that it was all right. Then we went
out in front and waited.</p>

<p>The first we saw of them was when Bill Wilson
turned into Park Street in a cloud of dust and
came tearing up the middle of the road on a jump.
The other boys were close behind, running to beat
the band, and every mother's son of them was
carrying a big club.</p>

<p>They didn't even yell when they saw us, they
were so nearly winded, but Bill, being corporal,
ran up to Skinny, gave the Scout salute, and then
whirled his club around his head three times.</p>

<p>It was great to see them come up that way, every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Scout whirling his club and all out of breath.
Skinny's eyes shone like stars, he was so proud, and
I saw Ma looking out of a window, surprised some,
I guess.</p>

<p>"Show 'em to us!" yelled Bill, as soon as he
could speak. "We'll eat 'em up."</p>

<p>"You'll get all the eating you want in about
five minutes," Skinny told him.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" yelled Bill again, while the
other boys marched up and stood in a row, each
with his club in the air.</p>

<p>"You are crazy," said Skinny. "Where's
who?"</p>

<p>"The Gingham Ground Gang. Didn't you tell
us the Gang was after you and for us to come
quick?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I said supper was ready and that
if you didn't get a move on yourselves you would
lose out."</p>

<p>"Ain't there going to be a fight?"</p>

<p>Just then Ma came out and it was a good thing
she did, because there might have been a fight, after
all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys," said she, smiling at us, "you are all
invited to stay to supper, and you will just about
have time to wash up and cool off a little. We
are having supper early to-night. I was so disappointed
when I found out that you had gone that
your patrol leader, Captain Miller, told me that he
would signal to you and that Corporal Wilson
would get you here on time if he had to run his
legs off. I don't exactly see how he did it but
you are here, that is certain. I've let your folks
know, so you can stay just as well as not, unless
you don't like my cooking."</p>

<p>When she said that the boys set up a shout, for
they knew all about Ma's cooking.</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me how you do it," she
added, turning back as she was going into the house.
"If your secretary would come like that when I
call him, I should be the proudest woman in the
village."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CAMPFIRE ON BOB'S HILL<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"JEE-RUSALEM, fellers," said Skinny a few
days later, "we're going to have a campfire
to-night on Bob's Hill. Mr. Norton, the Scoutmaster,
is going to be there, and he says for us
not to eat too much supper because there will be
something doing along about eight o'clock. It will
beat the Fourth of July."</div>

<p>We hardly could wait for evening to come. The
folks thought that I must be sick because I didn't
want much supper, until I told them about the
campfire.</p>

<p>"You'd better eat a bowl of bread and milk,
anyhow," said Ma. "If I know anything about
boys, and I have seen a few in my day, you will
be ready for another meal by eight o'clock."</p>

<p>I don't know how it is, but things always seem
to happen just as Ma says they will. Long before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
eight o'clock came we were waiting for Mr. Norton
at our house, as hungry as bears.</p>

<p>After a while he came along, lugging a big
basket and wearing a smile that would have made
us warm to him if we never had before.</p>

<p>"Captain," said he to Skinny, "if you will detail
two of your men to bring some water, we'll
get started. Of course, if we were going to make
a regular camp we should see that there was water
near. We'll have to carry it this time, but it isn't
far to the top of the hill. One of you might help
me with this basket; there seems to be something
in it."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later we were all at the top of
the hill and had brought some sticks from Plunkett's
woods for a fire and a curl of birch bark to
kindle it with.</p>

<p>"I understand that you boys came near burning
up the woods and village once with a fire up here,"
said Mr. Norton. "We must be careful about
that. Fire is a good servant but a very hard master.
We do not need a big blaze for a campfire,
so hot that we cannot sit around it. All we need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is just enough to look cheerful, to heat our coffee,
and furnish enough hot coals for cooking this
beefsteak."</p>

<p>He was unpacking the basket while he talked,
and Skinny was lighting the fire.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can tell you anything about
making fires and cooking. You boys just about
live out of doors in summer, so far as I have
observed. You are in great luck to have your
homes in a small village. If you should play some
of your pranks in a city, I am afraid that you
might become unpopular and the police might get
after you. Boys in great cities, like Chicago or
New York, know little of the freedom and sweetness
of country life."</p>

<p>He went over to a little clump of trees and
came back with a small branch, from which he
stripped the leaves and twigs. When he had finished
he had what he called a "pot hanger" of
green wood, about four feet long and with a kind
of crotch at the smaller end. He put the big end
under a stone, the right distance from the fire, and
drove a short, crotched stick into the ground to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hold the pot hanger over the blaze at the right
angle. When that was done all we had to do was
to hang a pail of water on the end of the pot
hanger and wait for the water to boil.</p>

<p>"I thought that we wouldn't bother with potatoes
this time," said he, "although they make good
eating when baked in hot ashes, as you boys probably
know. Mrs. Norton put in a whole stack of
bread and butter sandwiches and some other things,
which we must get rid of somehow, and Mrs. Smith
gave me this bag as we were leaving the house.
I don't know what is in it, and she told me not
to open it until the feast was ready."</p>

<p>We all kept our eyes on the bag and wondered
what was in it. I thought that I could make a
good guess, being better acquainted with Ma than
the other boys were, but I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>By the time the water was boiling the fire had
burned down to red-hot coals. Mr. Norton poured
the water over the coffee and set the pot in a hot
place. Then he began to get busy with the meat,
using a broiler which he had brought in the basket.
The delicious smell of the beefsteak and the coffee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
almost drove us crazy, and we began to be afraid
that it would bring the whole village up the hill
to us.</p>

<p>It seems as if every meal that we eat out of
doors that way is better than any which we ever
have had before. It grew dark before we had
finished Ma's doughnuts, which we found on opening
the bag. As we sat there we could see lights
begin to glow all up and down the valley and back
of us from an occasional farmhouse, up toward
Greylock. Stars came out overhead, and after a
little we saw a light in the sky above the East
mountain and knew that in a few minutes the moon
would come up.</p>

<p>After we had eaten all that we wanted, we
threw some wood on the coals to make a little blaze,
and then lay around and talked.</p>

<p>Finally Benny said, "I wish you would tell us
a story, Mr. Norton, like Mr. Baxter did out in
Illinois last summer."</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you a whole lot of stories
before we get through with our meetings," he replied,
"but let us discuss this Scout business a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more first. When you took the Scout's oath and
were enrolled in the Tenderfoot class, you pledged
your word of honor that you would do your duty
to God and your country, that you would help
other people at all times, and that you would obey
the Scout law. That Scout law is important. Suppose
we talk it over. Gabriel, you are leader, can
you tell us what the first law is?"</p>

<p>Skinny stood up and folded his arms.</p>

<p>"A Scout is trustworthy," said he.</p>

<p>"It is a great thing to be trustworthy; to be
dependable," said Mr. Norton. "In a few years,
you boys and others like you will be running this
country and the other countries which make up what
we call the civilized world. To you doubtless that
time seems far off. Let me tell you that it will be
here almost before you know it. It seems only
yesterday when I myself was a youngster like you."</p>

<p>"I'm going on twelve," Benny told him, "and
I have begun to grow again."</p>

<p>"The Band is dependable all right," said Skinny,
stabbing around in the air with his fork. "I mean
the patrol is. Bet your life, when they monkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with the Band they run up against a buzz
saw."</p>

<p>Bill didn't say a word, but he cawed three times;
then flapped his arms and crowed, and ended by
standing on his hands and kicking his feet in the
air. Bill didn't have to talk. He could do things
that made us know what he meant, without saying
a word.</p>

<p>"To be dependable," went on Mr. Norton,
"means more than to fight for your rights, or
for your country's rights. It means that in all
walks of life you must be ready to 'deliver the
goods.' When a Scout gives his word of honor
that settles it. That which he says is true, is true;
you can depend upon it, and he will do exactly what
he says he will do. That is a quality which we
greatly need in men as well as in boys, who soon
will be men."</p>

<p>"Corporal, what is the second law?"</p>

<p>Bill thought a minute and then said:</p>

<p>"A Scout is loyal."</p>

<p>"Right you are. You must be loyal to your
country, to your parents, to your officers, to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
employers, when you get to work. Loyalty is a
great thing. It means to stick together. One boy,
or one man, alone, cannot accomplish much. Several
working loyally together for a single object,
are a power. You and the Gingham Ground Gang
used to have considerable trouble, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"We do now," we told him, "except with Jim
Donavan. Jim is square and we'd like to have him
join us, but he won't leave the Gang; says it
wouldn't be right."</p>

<p>"That is the kind of boy we want for a Scout.
He is loyal and his honor is to be trusted. You
must help me to organize the Gang, as you call
them, into another patrol. But what I was going
to say is this: When you and the Gang were enemies,
which I hope you never will be again, what
would have happened if one of you had ventured
alone down near the gingham mills?"</p>

<p>"They would have done him up."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now suppose the eight of you had
stood together, back to back, shoulder to shoulder,
working against a common enemy?"</p>

<p>"We did once," said Benny, "and they licked us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
anyhow, but there were more of them than there
were of us."</p>

<p>"Bet your life they didn't lick us very bad,"
put in Skinny. "It was a snowball fight. They
drove us from their hill, but afterward they asked
us to come back and slide with them, and we did.
We had a fine time."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that in that case both sides won
a victory. The greatest victory a boy or man can
win is one over himself, over his own passions, his
selfishness and meanness. The greatest enemy
that he or his country can have will be found right
inside his own heart. There is where we all have
a fight on hand continually. But, remember, you
are Scouts and a Scout's honor is to be trusted."</p>

<p>"Benny, what is the next law?"</p>

<p>"A Scout is helpful."</p>

<p>"There you have it. The highest type of man
is the useful one. There was once an old philosopher
who said that he counted that day lost in
which he did no good deed. A Scout ought to
feel the same way. You must try to do something
for somebody every day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"They don't have giants and dragons, any more,"
said Skinny. "I wish they did; we'd paralyze
'em."</p>

<p>"Henry, what is the next one?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure whether it comes next or
not, but I think it does. The law says, 'A Scout
is a friend to all and a brother to every other
Scout.' Does that mean that we must be brothers
to the Gingham Ground Gang when they get to be
Scouts?"</p>

<p>"Surely it does. Why not? Your folks may
have a little more money than their folks and not
so much as some one else. What of it? There is
something better than money, and that something
is manhood. Don't be snobs, whatever you are."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Secretary, it is your turn."</p>

<p>"A Scout is courteous," I told him.</p>

<p>"Politeness is a great thing. If he lives up to
his pledge, a Scout will be courteous, especially in
his treatment of women and children who are
younger than he is, and of old people and those
who are feeble or handicapped in some way by
being crippled or sick. Don't forget that old men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
started as boys and that you boys, if you live, will
become old men. Now for number six."</p>

<p>"A Scout is kind and a friend to animals,"
Harry said.</p>

<p>"And the next?"</p>

<p>"A Scout is obedient," said Chuck.</p>

<p>"Now we are getting down to business. The
first duty of a soldier is to obey, and it is so important
that he should obey in time of war that a
soldier, or scout, who refused to obey orders would
be shot. You are supposed to obey orders without
question. Obey your parents especially. Obey
me as Scoutmaster. Obey your patrol leader; that
is your duty as Scouts. If the order does not suit
you, do your kicking afterward, not before. First
deliver the goods; then you will be in a position to
criticise, if necessary."</p>

<p>"We haven't heard from you, Wallie. Let's
have number eight."</p>

<p>"A Scout is cheerful."</p>

<p>"That's the idea. Don't grumble or whine.
That will never get you anywhere, or the world
anywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to say a few words about the next
law, 'A Scout is thrifty.' Thrift is of the greatest
importance. Save your money. Save your pennies.
Put them in the bank. I think they ought
to teach thrift and the importance of saving in
the public schools. It does not mean that you
should be stingy. When you boys worked hard
one winter and gave a purse of money to an unfortunate
stranger, you were living up to the highest
ideals of a Scout. It doesn't mean that money
is the most important thing in the world, for it
is far from it. But remember this: a man's first
duty to his country is to be self-supporting, and
to be self-supporting in his old age he must be
thrifty in his youth. He must make hay while
the sun shines. He must learn to save his money.
That is why a Tenderfoot must have one dollar
in the bank before he can become a Second Class
Scout, and a Second Class Scout must have two
dollars before he becomes a First Class Scout. The
habit of thrift is very important. When you grow
older and go to work, no matter what you earn,
I want you to save a part of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are three more laws," he went on, after
a minute, "and they speak for themselves: 'A
Scout is brave,' 'A Scout is clean,' 'A Scout is
reverent.' I need not tell you to be brave in the
presence of danger. Do you understand that sometimes
it takes greater courage to stand up for the
right? Keep yourselves clean; not only your bodies
but your thought and speech. And be reverent,
boys, toward God, who made old Greylock and
these beautiful hills for you to enjoy."</p>

<p>When he had finished Skinny started to throw
some wood on the fire, but Mr. Norton stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Never go away," he said, "leaving a fire where
it possibly can do any damage. We'll be going
home in a few minutes, and before we go this fire
must be put out. If the wind should come up in
the night the flames might spread into Plunkett's
woods."</p>

<p>We saw in a minute that he was right, and, taking
sticks, beat out what little fire there was; then
started down the hill.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I have been thinking," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Mr. Norton, when we were going through Blackinton's
orchard. "We have had so much fun to-night
that I should like to go camping with you
boys for a week, some time this summer. These
mountains and woods are just the places for scouting
and we could have a campfire every night.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>"We say yes," said Skinny, "if our folks will
let us, and I know they will."</p>

<p>"Can we play Indian, Mr. Norton?" asked
Benny.</p>

<p>"We certainly can. I think everybody likes to
get out into the woods and be an Indian once a
year. You boys have something to do first, however.
I want every one of you to be able to show
a First Class Scout badge."</p>

<p>"We can do most of the stunts now," I told
him, "only we haven't been seven miles and
back."</p>

<p>The book says that before becoming a First Class
Scout a boy must go on foot to a point seven miles
away and return again, and afterward to write a
short account of the trip. It says, too, that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
would be better to go one day and come back the
next, and that means to camp out all night.</p>

<p>That last was a hard thing to do because our
mothers did not want us to go off that way alone.
Mothers always seem to think a boy is going to
get hurt or something. Mr. Norton finally talked
them into it, all except Benny's mother. She
wouldn't stand for it. Benny cried, he felt so badly
about it.</p>

<p>"Do it in one day, then," Mr. Norton told him.
"Remember that the law says for you to obey
your parents without question. That is more important
than to do the stunt."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A FOURTEEN-MILE HIKE<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SCHOOL let out Thursday, June 22, and it had
seemed to us as if the day never would come.
Not that we don't like school because we do&mdash;sometimes;
but when the sap drips from the maples and
bees buzz around the pussywillows on the river
bank and all the trees take on a different look, as
if there was going to be something doing right
away, then the time has come for us to get out our
marbles and tops and to fix up the cave for the
summer.</div>

<p>Pretty soon the buds begin to throw off their
overcoats, and Bob's Hill grows green again in the
warm sunshine; the woods are bright with wild
flowers, and the songs of birds and smell of spring
fill the air.</p>

<p>Then the mountains and hills tease us away from
our books, when we look out of the window. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
river, all swelled up with joy and melting snows,
shouts for us to come on, every time we cross the
bridge. On Saturdays the brook at Peck's Falls,
grown big and noisy, roars out a welcome and tries
to say how glad it is to have us back at the cave
again.</p>

<p>Say, how can a boy sit quiet in school when
all those things are going on?</p>

<p>Last day finally came. It always does, no matter
how slowly the time seems to pass. The very
next morning the Ravens met to do the final stunts
that would make us First Class Scouts.</p>

<p>For more than a week we had thought of little
except the fourteen-mile hike. It took several
meetings before we could decide where to go. Our
first idea was to tramp up into the mountains somewhere,
but that scared our folks and we had to
give it up.</p>

<p>"It isn't as if you were all going together," said
Pa. "In that case, if one should get hurt the
others could take care of him and go for help.
If one of you alone should break your leg on the
mountain we might never be able to find you. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
think you'd better stick to civilization and the beaten
paths. You are not mollie-coddles and probably
would come out all right, anyhow. At the same
time, I should sleep better nights if I knew that my
boy wasn't off on the mountain somewhere, alone."</p>

<p>That left us only two directions to go, north and
south, because on the east and west there are mountains
and the valley between is narrow. South
near Cheshire Harbor it narrows down so much
that there is room only for a wagon road, the
river, and the railroad, side by side, but there is
another road part way up the hill on the east.</p>

<p>On that account we decided that all should not
go on the hike the same day, but to go four at a
time, each taking a different road. There are two
roads leading north to North Adams, one on each
side of the river, and two leading south. One goes
through Maple Grove and Cheshire Harbor to
Cheshire, where a lot of swell folks from New
York spend their summer vacations. The other,
as I have said, is part way up the east hill and
goes through a place, called Pumpkin Hook. It's
a queer name but we didn't name it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan that we finally decided on was for each
to follow one road one day for seven miles; then
go up into the hills somewhere to make camp for
the night, and the next day to go back again by
the other road. In that way we should stand a
chance of meeting two Scouts some time during
the trip, one on the morning of the second day,
when we would be crossing over to take the other
road, and one when the first boys on their way
home would pass the second boys on the way out.</p>

<p>We drew cuts to see who should be the first four
to go. Skinny, Harry, Wallie, and Bill won the
first chance. They were to start the next morning
at seven o'clock sharp from the bridge, two going
north and two south. Hank, Benny, Chuck, and
myself were to wait until seven o'clock, the second
day, and then start. When we all had come back,
we planned to meet Mr. Norton and tell him about
where we had been and what we had seen and
done.</p>

<p>Benny and I live nearest to the bridge. My
house is only a stone's throw north of it; Benny's
is a little north of mine and on the other side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Park Street. That made it easy for us to get to
the bridge first, but pretty soon the others began
to come.</p>

<p>"Has anybody seen Skinny?" I asked, looking
at Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>Skinny's house is near Mr. Norton's, and we had
thought that maybe they would come together.</p>

<p>"I stopped in as I passed," said he. "Mrs. Miller
told me that he had started."</p>

<p>Just then we heard a caw, sounding from over
toward Plunkett's woods somewhere. It didn't
take us long to answer. Then we watched down
the railroad track, where it curves into town between
the wooded hillside and the river.</p>

<p>We didn't have long to wait. In a few minutes
we saw Skinny put his head out between the trees
which line a high bank, fifteen or twenty feet above
the track. He looked carefully in every direction;
waved one arm, when he saw that we were watching,
and then dodged back again out of sight.</p>

<p>"He's surrounding something," said Bill, giving
a caw so loud it must have almost scared the crows
up in the Bellows Pipe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are only four minutes left before leaving
time."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was looking at his watch. He had
hardly spoken, when, with a whoop and yell, Skinny
slid down the embankment and was running like
mad up the track toward us, waving his hatchet
in one hand and swinging a rope around his head
with the other.</p>

<p>"One minute to spare," said Mr. Norton, smiling
as he put his watch back into his pocket. "That's
the way to do it. Be prompt. If you say that
you'll be somewhere at a certain time, be there."</p>

<p>"Say, Skinny," said Bill, winking at me and
giving the Scout salute, "did you get 'em surrounded?"</p>

<p>Skinny wouldn't answer, or even look at him
except to return the salute. He pulled out his own
watch, held it a moment; then pounded on the
bridge with his hatchet.</p>

<p>"The meetin' will come to order?" said he.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the bell on the woolen mill began
to ring and we knew that it was seven o'clock and
time to start.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite a little crowd had gathered by that time
and there was a cheer when the boys started, Skinny
and Harry marching south on Center Street, side
by side, and Bill and Wallie, north on Park Street.</p>

<p>Pretty soon their ways branched off. They
turned and waved to us; then were gone. Once
after that we heard some crows cawing in the
distance, and a little later I heard Bill yell from
somewhere down the river. I knew that he was
doing his best, but I hardly could hear him.</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to wait until the next day, with
the other boys gone and knowing that we should
have to do it, too, in the morning.</p>

<p>Pa said that maybe the time would pass more
quickly if I'd hoe in the garden a spell, but it didn't
seem to make any difference. My mind was following
the boys, especially Skinny, on his long
walk over a hilly road to Pumpkin Hook.</p>

<p>"Scout's law says that we must be useful and
help others," he had told us, "and, bet your life,
I am going to do things."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said he, after a minute, "I can rescue
some fair damsel in distress, like the knights used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to do, even if there ain't any dragons now-a-days.
The road goes too far from the river for me to
save anybody from drowning; unless I come back
by the river road."</p>

<p>In the evening Benny and I sat out on the woodpile,
talking about it. We wondered where the
boys were making their camps, if anything would
happen to them and if Skinny had rescued anybody
yet.</p>

<p>That night I dreamed that I was on the way. I
met a little, old woman, going to market, and
carried her basket for her.</p>

<p>"Noble boy," said she. "Because of your kind
act I'll change shoes with you. Mine hurt my
feet."</p>

<p>I didn't like to do it very well because her shoes
were old and shabby, but Scout law says to be
courteous. So I thanked her as well as I could
and put them on.</p>

<p>And, say, they were magic shoes. I got to
North Adams in about three jumps and liked it
so well that I went on to Boston. I was just
going to sleep on Boston Common when a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
policeman grabbed me by one shoulder and gave
me a shake.</p>

<p>"Quit!" I said. "A Scout's honor is to be
trusted."</p>

<p>"John! John!" came a voice. "It's time to
be up and away."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and there was Pa, laughing
down at me.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty Scout," said he. "It's after
six o'clock and you have to start at seven."</p>

<p>Ma hated to see me go, knowing that I'd be
out all night, but Pa didn't care, or pretended that
he didn't.</p>

<p>"He's all right," he said. "What's going to
hurt him, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>Before seven o'clock the four of us were at the
bridge and, say, we looked fine in our uniforms.
Each one carried a little pan to cook in, some bacon
and other things to eat, and a blanket strapped on
his back. We also carried "first aid to injured"
things, to be ready if we should find somebody
getting hurt.</p>

<p>When the bells rang for seven o'clock we started.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
This time it was Benny and I who went north on
Park Street, and Hank and Chuck, south.</p>

<p>"You watch my smoke," whispered Hank to me,
when we were ready to start. "I've got a new
invention and I'm going to try it on somebody."</p>

<p>When we were passing Benny's house Mrs. Wade
came out and waved to us.</p>

<p>"Benny Wade," she shouted, "if you are not
home by nine o'clock to-night, your mother will
have a fit."</p>

<p>I knew from the look on Benny's face how hard
it was for him to be cheerful, when he wanted to
stay out all night, like the rest of us.</p>

<p>"All right, Ma," said he. "Don't worry. I'll
come back, if I live."</p>

<p>"If you live!" I heard her yell; but Benny was
turning the corner to take the east road and in
another second was out of sight.</p>

<p>At first I hardly could believe that I really was
on the way. I took Mr. Norton's message out of
my pocket and looked at it, to make sure, several
times. He had given each of us a message to some
one at the end of the line and told us to bring back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a receipt or an answer. Mine was to a man in
North Adams.</p>

<p>The Bob's Hill boys are used to walking. That
didn't bother me any. But somehow this was different
from any other walk that I ever had taken.
I suppose it was because it was so important and
because I was all alone.</p>

<p>I walked along at pretty good speed until I had
almost reached the Gingham Grounds. Then I
slowed down and kept my eyes open for the Gang,
hoping that I should see Jim Donavan somewhere.
Jim was their captain and one of our best friends,
but some of the others had it in for us.</p>

<p>I had begun to think that I was going to get
through all right, without any trouble, when I
saw one of them coming toward me. He was one
of the best fighters in the Gang, too, and he had
a dog with him. Jim was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Isn't it queer what things will come into your
head when you are scared? Pa says that I can't
remember twenty-five cents' worth of groceries
from our house to the store; but that is something
else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>I was scared, all right, and wanted to run, because
fighting always is scary until after you get
started. Then, all of a sudden, I thought of something
that Pa had once read to me about General
Grant. Grant was marching up a hill once, expecting
to find the enemy on the other side and
wanting to run all the time, only he was too
proud. Then when he reached the top, where
he could see down into the enemy's camp, he
found that they had been more scared than
he was and not so proud, for they had run
away.</p>

<p>"So," said he, or something like it, "no matter
how frightened you are, or how much you want to
run, remember that the other fellow probably is
just as badly scared as you are."</p>

<p>When I thought of that I braced up and walked
along fast, pretending that I was in a hurry and
didn't see him, but keeping one eye on him, just
the same, and the other on a stone which lay in
the road, near where the dog stood whining. The
boy was patting his head and trying to coax him
along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>He pretended that he didn't see me, too, until
I was passing. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Hello, you village guy," said he.</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself," I said, stopping and edging
toward the stone.</p>

<p>"Where do you think you are going?"</p>

<p>"North Adams."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just for fun."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said he. "Ain't the trains runnin'?"</p>

<p>"I've got something that's better than trains.
It's legs."</p>

<p>"What's the uniform for?"</p>

<p>"Anything the matter?" I asked, after I had
told him that I was a Boy Scout, for I could see
that he was feeling badly about something.</p>

<p>"It's my dog," he told me, rubbing his sleeve
across his eyes. "Somebody broke his leg with a
stone and I've got to kill him. He's all I have."</p>

<p>"A Scout should be kind to animals," I said to
myself. "A Scout is a friend to all." "A Scout
should be useful."</p>

<p>Then I answered myself back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the use? This ain't any damsel-in-distress
business, like Skinny is going to do. Besides,
if I hurry maybe I'll get a chance to
signal to Benny from the turn in the road on
ahead."</p>

<p>"Come on and help me kill him," said he.</p>

<p>Just then the dog gave such a pitiful whine that
I couldn't stand it, Benny or no Benny. So I took
out my bandage.</p>

<p>"I think I can fix his leg, if you'll help me," I
told him. "Get me a couple of sticks."</p>

<p>I told him what I wanted, and when he had
brought them and I had whittled them into shape
to use as splints, I fitted the broken bones in place
and bandaged the leg, just as Mr. Norton had
taught us, while the boy held the dog. The dog
yelped a little, but seemed to know that I was
doing it to help him.</p>

<p>"It will soon grow together," I said, when I
had finished, "and then it will be almost as good
as new."</p>

<p>It made me feel kind of queer and happy to see
how glad he was. The dog licked my hand, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and seemed to be trying to say something. I wish
dogs could talk.</p>

<p>"How did you come to know so much?" he
asked. "Is your father a doctor?"</p>

<p>Then I told him all about the Scouts and our
hike and what Mr. Norton had said about wanting
the Gang to join.</p>

<p>"Bully!" said he. "We'll do it. The others
went up on the mountain this morning after berries.
I'd have gone, too, only for the dog. But I'll tell
them when they get home to-night."</p>

<p>"Say," I called out, after I had started on.
"You know Benny Wade, don't you?"</p>

<p>"The kid what always goes around with youse?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him when I see him. Why?"</p>

<p>"He'll come through here this evening some
time, on his way back from North Adams. Let
him look at the dog and see if he is all right. He
knows as much about those things as I do. Bill
Wilson ought to be along some time during the day
on his way back. He started yesterday. Say, you
ought to see Bill do up a leg."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing happened after that, although I kept
close watch of the river, hoping that I might find
somebody drowning. Some boys were in swimming
at one place, but they were not drowning nor
anywhere near it.</p>

<p>I could have reached North Adams easily long
before noon, if I had wanted to, but I had all
day to do it in, so loafed along, expecting to meet
Bill every minute. I rested in the shade whenever
I felt like it. But although I did a lot of cawing
every few minutes and kept a sharp look-out, I
didn't see Bill, and I didn't hear him, which I
couldn't understand, unless he had taken the east
road home to keep away from the Gingham
Grounds.</p>

<p>At noon I went down by the river, cut a pole,
and fished a little, although I didn't catch anything.
I didn't build a fire and cook because I had
a good lunch in my pack. It seemed sort of lonesome,
being there so far away and knowing I
couldn't go home when night came.</p>

<p>After a long rest I walked on until I came to a
bridge, and then, feeling sure Benny must be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
North Adams by that time, I crossed over to the
east road, where I knew some folks, and went up
into the hills to where Hoosac Tunnel begins. It
was fun to see the trains dart in and out of that
great hole which reaches four miles through the
mountain, and I sat there a long time watching.</p>

<p>Four o'clock came before I found my man in
North Adams and delivered the message. By that
time I was tired enough to go into camp for the
night. He smiled when he saw me coming in my
Scout uniform.</p>

<p>"This letter," said he, when he had read it,
"says for me to buy you a life size ice cream
soda? Do you want it?"</p>

<p>There isn't anything in Scout law, is there, which
says a Scout mustn't eat ice cream soda? And the
tireder and hotter you are the better it tastes,
doesn't it? I guess yes. Only I wished that Benny
was there, eating one with me.</p>

<p>That night I camped on the bank of a brook,
part way up the mountain and a mile or more beyond
the city. The water was clear as crystal and
seemed kind of company, for it gurgled as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
poured over the stones, making music that was
great.</p>

<p>I hardly could wait to build a fire and fry my
bacon, I was so hungry. But what is the use of
carrying bacon and a pan seven miles, unless you
fry the stuff after you get there? I tell you it
tasted good and so did the wild strawberries that I
picked afterward for dessert.</p>

<p>But when it began to grow dark and lights shone
out down in the city and in the sky above, and
queer sounds came from the mountain and woods
back of me, I'd have given fifteen cents to have
been at home, or at any rate, to have had somebody
with me.</p>

<p>After a while I heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"A Scout should smile and look pleasant."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who&mdash;is that talking?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's your friend, the brook," came back the
answer, in a sweet, gurgly voice. "I'm a Scout,
too. Hear me sing."</p>

<p>"So am I," came the deep voice of the mountain
back of me. "A Scout should be brave. Sleep,
my brother. I'll watch over you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"So are we Scouts," came in whisperings from
every side, through the darkness, and I knew that
the trees were talking to me. "We'll take care of
you."</p>

<p>Then I grew brave all in a minute and started
up to go to them. As I did so, the darkness fled,
leaving me there lying on the ground in broad
daylight, while the brook sang its loudest and all
the trees waved good-morning. Would you believe
it? I had slept all night long and dreamed
that about the brook and the mountain.</p>

<p>On the way home, I came in sight of the houses
of the village before ten o'clock, tired but happy
because I had done the last test and now could be a
First Class Scout.</p>

<p>Benny met me outside the village, and he looked
scared when he saw that I was alone.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Bill Wilson?" he shouted, as
soon as he could make me hear.</p>

<p>"I missed him somewhere," I called. "He must
have come back by the east road. Why? What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>He already was hurrying home so fast that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hardly could catch up with him. As he ran he
shouted back over his shoulder something that set
my heart to beating and made me forget how tired
I was.</p>

<p>"Bill hasn't come back."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"BILL HASN'T COME BACK"<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ALL it meant to say that Bill hadn't come back
did not come over me until I found myself
hurrying after Benny down Park Street. Bill had
left home on the morning of the second day before,
intending to camp out one night and come back the
next day. Two nights had passed and he was
still away. What had become of him?</div>

<p>I hurried along faster and faster, thinking of
all the things that might have happened. Mr.
Norton and Bill's folks reached the house almost
as soon as I did. I don't know how they found
out that I had come back.</p>

<p>Bill's folks were nearly crazy about him. The
first night out, they expected him to be away, of
course, and so did not worry much. When dinner
time came the next day and he hadn't showed up,
they began to wonder what was keeping him, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
other boys who had started at the same time were
home.</p>

<p>When night came again and he still was away,
they began to grow very anxious and sent for Mr.
Norton.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said he. "I supposed
that he had come home long ago, and have been too
busy to find out. The other three are back, I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, they came back in time for dinner."</p>

<p>"I am surprised that William is still out, but
do not feel alarmed, Mrs. Wilson. Something has
detained him, but it cannot be anything serious.
Both roads to North Adams are well traveled and
the farmhouses are near together. As likely as
not he stopped to help somebody out of a difficulty
and it has taken longer than he expected. One of
our laws, you know, says that a Scout's duty is
to be useful and to do somebody a good turn every
day. I'll run over and talk with Wallace. They
started together and may have met when they
crossed over from one road to the other."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was more anxious than he pretended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Wallie said that he hadn't seen him and hadn't
heard him, which was worse, for Bill usually could
be heard a long way off. Wallie said that he had
called to him every few rods when crossing over
to the west road beyond North Adams but hadn't
heard a thing. It would have been easy for them
to miss each other, unless they happened to take
the same crossroad.</p>

<p>"I might get track of him in North Adams,"
said Mr. Norton, after a little. "You see, I gave
him a message to deliver to a friend of mine there.
He surely will know something about him, but he
hasn't a telephone and I think is out of town to-day,
anyhow. Maybe I'd better drive up. The
boy probably will get back before I do, but it will
make me feel better to be doing something."</p>

<p>By that time everybody was getting scared. I
mean all our folks were. Mrs. Wade was sure
that Benny never would come home again, although
it wasn't quite nine o'clock, the time when he said
he would come.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wade is all right most of the time, only
she can think of more trouble for Benny to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
into than he could find in a week, if he looked for
it. Mothers are often that way. I guess it is because
they like us so well.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"He said he would come back, if he lived.
Those were his last words. And he hasn't come."</p>

<p>She told that to Ma, over and over again.</p>

<p>"He'll come back all right," said Ma, "and so
will John, when the time comes."</p>

<p>But she was worried about me, just the same,
all on account of Bill. Of course, I didn't
know about it at the time. I found out afterward.</p>

<p>No one ever made better time driving the six
miles to North Adams than Mr. Norton did that
night. Just outside the village he met Benny, coming
on a run, and stopped long enough to ask him
if he had seen Bill.</p>

<p>"No," said he. "I missed him. The Gang
held me up at the Gingham Ground and almost
made me late. I told Ma that I would be home
by nine o'clock if I lived. I'm 'most dead, but
guess I can hold out until I get there. She'll be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
having a fit pretty soon if I don't hurry. What
time is it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Mr. Norton whipped up his horse before Benny
finished.</p>

<p>"William hasn't come back!" he shouted over
his shoulder, just as Benny called to me in
almost the same place. Then he tore down the
road toward the Gingham Ground.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when he came back. There
was a light burning in our house and he
stopped.</p>

<p>"He has not been there!" was all that he could
say, when Pa met him at the door.</p>

<p>"Hasn't been there!"</p>

<p>"No, I found Jenks, to whom I had sent the
message, and he said that he had seen nothing of
him, although he had been expecting him. You
see, I told him that the boy was coming. The
message has not been delivered."</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith," he went on, after a moment, "I
can't face Mrs. Wilson with that news. You go
to her, while I get the marshal started and see if
something cannot be done. I tell you something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
has happened. I am convinced of that. Young
Wilson would have delivered that message if he
possibly could have reached the place, and it would
have taken a great deal to stop him. There isn't
a yellow streak in that boy anywhere."</p>

<p>"Did you make any inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I stopped at every house along the road
where there was a light burning. Not a person
had seen him, although several had seen your boy
on the way out. At North Adams I notified the
police, but I don't know what they can do."</p>

<p>"I'll go to Mrs. Wilson right away," Pa told
him. "This certainly is bad business, but we can't
do much until morning. As soon as it is daylight
we'll send out a search party. There are only two
roads, unless he went up through the Notch, which
is not at all probable. It ought not to be a difficult
matter to get some trace of him."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where he is," he went on, after
thinking a minute. "He met my John and went
back to camp all night with him. They will come
home together to-morrow; you see if they don't.
John is a pretty safe boy. He's full of pranks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
like the others, but he is more cautious. He'll
come home all right and bring Bill with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton shook his head.</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope so," he said, "but it is not at
all probable. Mr. Smith, I never will forgive myself
if anything has happened to that boy."</p>

<p>"You are not to blame at all," Pa told him.
"Depend upon it, if anything has happened, and
we don't know that there has, the boy himself is
to blame. He is a fine lad, but is a little reckless
and thoughtless at times. Cheer up. It might
be a lot worse. Now, if the boys had gone up into
the mountains as they talked of doing at first, there
would be real cause for worry."</p>

<p>That was why Benny waited for me outside the
village the next day, and why Mr. Norton and
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson met me at the house and why
Skinny and the other boys came in a few minutes
afterward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson knew by my face that I had not
seen anything of Bill and burst out crying.</p>

<p>"There couldn't have anything happened to
him, Mrs. Wilson," I told her, sort of choking up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in my throat, myself, because she was feeling so
bad. "I mean anything much. Maybe a tramp
locked him up somewhere when he was asleep, or
some gipsies stole him. I saw some gipsies up
above North Adams and they were going west
to beat the band. But he'll get away from them.
I'll bet on Bill every time."</p>

<p>When I spoke of gipsies to make Mrs. Wilson
feel better it seemed to scare her worse than ever.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Pa. "Gipsies don't go
around stealing thirteen-year-old boys, who can
make as much noise as Bill can."</p>

<p>"Well, I saw some, anyhow," I told him.</p>

<p>Just then Skinny jumped out in front of the rest
of us, with his eyes shining and his cheeks redder
than I ever had seen them before, and stood there
with his arms folded, like a bandit, or a Scout, I
don't know which.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said he, "Scouts, I mean. We got
Bill into this scrape and we will get him out again.
This is a job for us, not for the police. If anybody
can find Bill, bet your life we can. We know
the call of the Ravens. We know the signs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
we know Bill better than his own folks know him.
We'll track him. We'll follow him to the ends of
the earth. Will you go with me?"</p>

<p>We sprang up with a cheer, forgetting how tired
we were, those of us who had just come home from
the long walk.</p>

<p>"Everybody scatter and look for signs."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, boys," said Ma. "It's almost
dinner time. You must not start without something
to eat. There is no telling when you will
get back. Let me give you a bite in the kitchen
first."</p>

<p>That was just like Ma. We saw in a minute it
was the thing to do and hurried in for a quick
lunch.</p>

<p>"The boy is right," we heard Pa saying.
"They'll find him, depend upon it. I never knew
those boys to get into a scrape yet that they couldn't
pull out of. But it won't hurt if the rest of us
look around a little, too."</p>

<p>"Who saw him last?" asked Skinny, after we
had started.</p>

<p>"I did," said Wallie. "We walked together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
until I turned off to take the east road. He kept
straight on toward the Gingham Ground and I
heard him yell some time afterward."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose that the Gang got after him,
do you, and locked him up or something?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet that's what they did," said Benny.
"That is just what happened. They got after me,
too. I was scared half to death and didn't want
to go through the Grounds, but it was getting late
and I knew that Ma would be worried, so I braced
up and started through on a run. In a minute two
of them ran out and grabbed me by the collar."</p>

<p>"'It's one of them village kids,' said one of them.
'Let's call the Gang and duck him. He needs it
to cool off.'</p>

<p>"Then he whistled and a lot of the others came
and they hustled me down to the river. Gee, I
was mad and I was scared. Then, just as I had
about given up, another boy came chasing after us.</p>

<p>"'Is this Benny Wade?' said he.</p>

<p>"'It's all that is left of me,' I told him.</p>

<p>"With that he jumped in and took hold of me.</p>

<p>"'Youse ain't a goin' to duck this kid,' said he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
'unless you duck me along with him. His partner
came through here this morning and fixed my dog's
broken leg and he told me to watch out for Benny
Wade and have him look at the bandage, to see if
it was all right. Now, kid, you come along with
me and look at my dog.'</p>

<p>"'Duck 'em both,' said some one.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe they would have done it, too,
if Jim Donavan hadn't come along just in time."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was Bill who fixed up the dog," said
Hank.</p>

<p>"No, I did it," I told them.</p>

<p>We had been walking along while Benny was
talking. What he said surprised us some and
would have made us mad at any other time. Benny
had been so worried about Bill that he hadn't said
anything about himself before, and neither had any
of us.</p>

<p>"The first thing to do," said Skinny, "is to go
to Jim's house and start from there. If Bill went
through the Gingham Ground I'll bet that some of
the Gang saw him."</p>

<p>The place which we call the Gingham Ground is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a settlement near some big gingham mills. There
are two long rows of brick tenement houses with
a street between. We knew that Skinny was right,
because Bill would have had to walk down that
street between the rows of houses, and some one
would have been sure to see him. He might have
stopped at Jim's, or, anyhow, would have called to
him when he passed.</p>

<p>It didn't take us long to get there, and as we
came near we could see the Gang getting together.
You see, they thought we were after them on account
of what they had done to Benny.</p>

<p>We didn't pay much attention to them but went
straight to Jim's house and found him eating dinner.
He was surprised to see us and was glad.</p>

<p>"Wait until I call the Gang," said he, after we
had told him about Bill.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had all come up, as friendly
as could be when they found out that we were not
looking for a fight.</p>

<p>Not one of them had seen Bill. They all knew
him and they felt sure that if he had gone through
in daylight some of them would have seen him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'd better do," said Jim,
finally. "I don't believe that he came this way, but,
to make sure, the Gang will work north from here
and ask at every house. You go back and look
between here and the village. If he left there and
didn't get as far as this, then he must have turned
off somewhere."</p>

<p>We went back, stopping at every house we came
to, on each side of the road. We couldn't find a
person who remembered having seen him or any
one like him. You see, if he passed at all, it must
have been soon after seven o'clock in the morning.
The men had gone to work in the mills and the
women were busy in the back parts of the houses.</p>

<p>Then we started back again, not knowing what
to do next. There was one house, larger than the
others, which we had not visited, because it stood
high above the road on a hillside and could be
reached only by a long driveway. It was about
halfway between the Gingham Ground and our
house in the village. We couldn't think of anything
else to do, so we went up there.</p>

<p>"I don't remember seeing any one," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
lady who met us at the door. "Of course, there
are boys passing at all hours of the day. I might
have seen him."</p>

<p>We looked at Skinny in despair.</p>

<p>"This one," said he, "was probably making a
noise. Maybe he was cawing like a crow."</p>

<p>"I saw him, Mama," shouted a little girl, who
had come up and stood listening. "I saw a boy
go past, making an awful racket, and it sounded
something like a crow."</p>

<p>"Was he carrying anything?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, he had a rolled-up blanket on his back.
I remember thinking he looked funny and wondering
what he was going to do with it. Oh, yes, he
had on a uniform, too."</p>

<p>"It was Bill, all right," said Skinny. "We've
struck the trail at last."</p>

<p>We went down to the road and talked it over.</p>

<p>"He passed here," said Skinny, "on time and
going north, and he didn't pass through the Gingham
Ground. We feel sure of that much. He
must have turned off somewhere in the next half-mile."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"We know something else," I told him. "He
couldn't have turned east, because the river is in
the way and there isn't any bridge."</p>

<p>We made up our minds to separate, one party to
work north from where we were standing; one to
work south from the Gingham Ground, and the
others to work in between, to see if we could find
where he had left the road.</p>

<p>"Look for a sign," said Skinny, "and look on
the west side. There isn't much chance for finding
footprints."</p>

<p>Hank was the one who found it. We heard him
yell and went to him on a run.</p>

<p>He came out to the roadside and waited for us,
waving his hat in the air, he was so excited; then,
when we had come up, took us back from the road
through a sort of lane, which pretty soon turned
south and wound off through the woods.</p>

<p>Just at the turn stood a big stone, out of sight
from the road. That is why we had not seen it
before. On the stone was something which set us
all yelling.</p>

<p>It was a circle and in the circle was the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of a crow and there was an arrow. It was the
Scout sign for "I took this path." The crow
meant that whoever drew the sign belonged to
Raven Patrol. We knew then that it was
Bill.</p>

<p>"We've got him," shouted Skinny. "He went
through this way so as not to meet the Gang."</p>

<p>It did look like that, but although we examined
every inch of the way between there and the Gingham
Ground, we couldn't find another sign of any
kind. And we couldn't understand why he had
not delivered the message to Mr. Jenks and come
back home.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully we made our way out to the sign
again and sat down to rest and talk about what to
do next.</p>

<p>"Guess what!" said Benny, after a little.
"That arrow doesn't point toward the Gingham
Ground at all. It points straight back from the
road. Let's go that way and see."</p>

<p>There didn't seem to be much use in doing it, but
we had to do something.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Skinny, springing up. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is somewhere; that's a cinch, and we know that he
was all right when he drew that sign."</p>

<p>We hurried along and soon struck a little path,
up which we ran as fast as we could, for it was
growing late.</p>

<p>"Look for another sign," warned Skinny.
"Scouts and Injuns always mark the paths they
take."</p>

<p>"Hurrah, here it is!" he shouted, a little farther
on.</p>

<p>When we had come up, he pointed to a stone,
which had been placed in the middle of the path,
with a smaller stone on top of it. It was the
Indian sign for "This is the trail."</p>

<p>We couldn't understand it, for it was leading
away from North Adams.</p>

<p>We hurried on, calling every now and then, but
not a sound could we hear, except the birds and
squirrels, and not another sign or track could we
find.</p>

<p>All that time we were going uphill and away
from North Adams. At last, we came out of the
woods on top of the hill, where we could see up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and down the valley, and Greylock over beyond.
Feeling too disappointed to speak we threw ourselves
down on the grass.</p>

<p>Suddenly Skinny gave a yell and we thought for
a moment that he had gone crazy.</p>

<p>"Look! Look! Look there!" he shouted,
pointing back at the mountain.</p>

<p>We looked; then, when the full meaning of what
we saw came to us, grew as excited as he was, threw
our hats in the air, and danced around and cheered
ourselves hoarse.</p>

<p>From the very top of Greylock, two columns
of smoke were going almost straight up, for there
happened to be no wind to speak of. If it was
Bill, and we felt sure that it was, those two columns
of smoke meant:</p>

<p>"I have lost the camp. Help."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SMOKE SIGNALS ON THE MOUNTAIN<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BEFORE Bill started on his trip he made up
his mind that he would walk farther and do
a bigger stunt than any of us. When Bill Wilson
is for anything, he is for it. There is no halfway
doings with him. He didn't take to the Scout
business very well at first because he didn't know
much about it and thought that Indians or bandits
would be better. But as soon as he had joined he
cared more than anybody.</div>

<p>Trying to do more than the other Scouts did
was what got him into trouble. He started for
North Adams, the same as Wallie, Benny, and
myself, and he took with him a message for Mr.
Jenks, as I have said. But a seven-mile walk and
back again the next day was not good enough for
Bill. He made up his mind that he would deliver
the message first and then go on as far as Williamstown
and stay all night there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Williamstown is five or six miles west of North
Adams. There is a big college there, called Williams
College. I guess it was the name that made
Bill think of going there.</p>

<p>Our valley runs north and south until it gets to
North Adams and then turns west. Hoosac River
turns with it. After flowing north all the time,
which everybody knows is no way for a river to
flow, it turns west, and so finally reaches the Hudson.
Then, of course, its waters flow south in the
Hudson and at last reach the Atlantic Ocean at
New York.</p>

<p>After Bill had left Wallie the first morning of
his trip, he walked along lively, knowing that he
had a long way to go to Williamstown, and he did
a lot of cawing on the road, just as Skinny thought.
Nothing happened to him at all until he found himself
almost to the Gingham Ground. Then he saw
five or six members of the Gang playing ball near
where he would pass.</p>

<p>That made him stop. Bill is brave, all right, but
what is the good of being brave when they are six
to your one, and the whole six have it in for you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>That is what Bill thought, anyhow, and he
started to leave the road and try to work around
out of sight through the woods and fields. Then
he thought of something to do, which scared him
at first, but the more he thought about it, the more
he wanted to do it.</p>

<p>Hoosac Valley, as I have said, swings off toward
the west at North Adams. That brings Williamstown
on the opposite side of Greylock from where
we live.</p>

<p>We found that out once when we went up on the
mountain and came near getting lost, which you
know if you have read about the doings of the
Band. Almost straight down in front of us, on
the east, was our village, with Bob's Hill back of
it, looking flat and not like a hill at all. We could
tell that it was Bob's Hill because we could see
the twin stones, standing there like tiny thimbles
on a table. Looking north, we could see North
Adams; looking south, Cheshire, and on the west
side of the mountain and a little north, was Williamstown.</p>

<p>Bill thought of that when he was wondering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
how he could pass the Gingham Ground without
the Gang's seeing him.</p>

<p>"What's the use of going that way at all?" he
said to himself. "What's the matter with going
straight back over the hills, climbing Greylock, and
then, after seeing exactly where Williamstown is,
making a bee line for it? I can deliver the message
on the way back."</p>

<p>Say, that would be a great stunt! We are going
to do it some time, when we get bigger and our
folks get over being scared.</p>

<p>He wanted to prove to us that he had done it;
so made signs at different places on the way, beginning
where he turned off the road. We struck
the trail at the second sign.</p>

<p>Bill can beat us all climbing and he went along
fast, having a lot of fun all by himself. There
is a path which leads up on Greylock from the
Gingham Ground; he followed that.</p>

<p>Before he had gone far he found a couple of
bottles, which some one had thrown away, and
he hung those around his neck with a string. He
took them both so that one would balance the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
other. You see, he knew that there was no water
on Greylock. It has to be carried there from some
spring part way up. The day was hot, and he
was thirsty, already.</p>

<p>When the sun grew hotter he took it easy along,
picking berries and lying around in the shade. He
didn't get to the spring, where he was going to fill
his bottles, until almost noon. After that there
was a hard climb to get to the top, as steep as
Bob's Hill, maybe steeper in places.</p>

<p>He stopped at the spring to rest and eat his
lunch; also to fix some signs.</p>

<p>At last he stood on the very top of Greylock,
which, as you probably know, is the highest mountain
in the State of Massachusetts, and it has all
kinds of mountains. Our geography says that it
is 3,505 feet high. Those last five feet seemed a
mile to Bill, and they would to you, if you were
climbing the mountain on a hot day, with a pack
on your back and two bottles of water hanging
from your neck.</p>

<p>I guess there never had been so much cawing
on the top of Greylock as when Bill stood there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
after his hard climb, looking down on the hills,
which did not seem like hills, he was so much
higher.</p>

<p>The air was so clear that Williamstown seemed
close. So, after resting a few minutes and drawing
the sign on a flat rock to show which way he
had gone, he started down the west side of the
mountain on a run, whooping and yelling like an
Indian at every jump.</p>

<p>Then, just as he was thinking how easy it was
and what fun he would have bragging to us boys
about what he had done, he caught his foot in a
root or something, fell headlong, rolled down until
he struck a tree; then lay still.</p>

<p>How long he had lain there, when he finally
came to life again, he couldn't tell. At first he
didn't know where he was or what had happened.
Then he remembered and tried to get on his feet
and go on.</p>

<p>With a cry of pain, he sank back again. He had
sprained his ankle and hardly could move it without
yelling.</p>

<p>When Robinson Crusoe was shipwrecked on an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
island he wrote on a piece of paper the good things
and the bad things that had happened to him. To
start with, he wrote on one side, "I am shipwrecked
on an island," or something like that, and on the
other, "but I am alive."</p>

<p>Bill did the same, only he didn't write it. He
thought it.</p>

<p>"I've busted my ankle," he said to himself, "but
I didn't break my bottles or spill my water.</p>

<p>"I can't walk a step, but I can yell to beat the
band.</p>

<p>"I can't get to Williamstown and I can't get
home, but I have something to eat in my pack and
plenty of matches in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows where I am, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That last "but" was to much for Bill. He
couldn't find anything to go with it, for he began
to think of what Pa had told us, that if a person
should get hurt on the mountain he might die there
and not be found for weeks or years. His ankle
was aching fearfully, too.</p>

<p>He tried yelling for a while and Bill is the best
yeller that I ever saw or heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he cried. "HELP!"</p>

<p>He might as well have saved his breath for all
the good it did.</p>

<p>Then he lay still for a long time, trying to think
what to do. That was what Mr. Norton had told
us.</p>

<p>"If anything happens," said he, "don't lose your
heads. Think it over calmly. Decide what is best
to do and then do it."</p>

<p>"I'm a Scout," said Bill to himself, "and, bet
your life, I ain't a going to stay here and die on
no mountain."</p>

<p>He took off his shoe and stocking and bathed his
ankle in water from one of the bottles&mdash;not much
water because he couldn't spare it, and he took a
little sip himself. Then he thought of his "first
aid to the injured" package.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with bandaging myself?"
said he. "It will be good practice."</p>

<p>When he had finished and had rested a few minutes,
he found that his ankle did not hurt him quite
so much and that he could move around a little, if
he didn't bear any weight on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought at first that he would crawl on his
hands and knees to Williamstown, or until he came
to some house, but when he tried he found that
he couldn't do it.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I can do," he said at last,
because he liked to hear somebody talking, even
if it was only himself. "Maybe I can crawl
back to the top of Greylock. Nobody ever
would find me here and folks sometimes go up
there."</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts of Raven Patrol think that it
took grit to crawl up the steep and rough mountainside,
with his ankle hurting at every move so
badly that it made him feel faint.</p>

<p>It wasn't far to the top, but Bill thought he
never would get there, he had to stop so many times
to rest and wait for the pain to go away. An hour
or more passed before he finally crawled out into
the clearing, with nothing but the blue sky above
him.</p>

<p>It was then getting late in the afternoon. Skinny
was at Pumpkin Hook by that time, probably surrounding
the enemy. Wallie was somewhere in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
North Adams or beyond. I was hoeing the garden
at the very foot of Greylock, little thinking that
Bill was in so much trouble on top.</p>

<p>The summit of Greylock is almost level and is
not very large. On the east side Bill saw a lot
of brush which somebody had cut and piled up,
probably to make a big fire; then for some reason
had not lighted it.</p>

<p>He crawled over to that after the sun went down,
built a little fire, and cooked a small piece of bacon
for his supper, which he ate with a piece of bread
and butter. It tasted good, but it made him thirsty
and he didn't dare drink much water.</p>

<p>Then, being tired out and more comfortable, he
said his prayer and repeated all of the Scout laws,
from being loyal to being reverent, wondering
what good it was doing him to have two dollars
in the bank down in the village, and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was broad daylight. Benny
and I were just starting on our hikes, down in
Park Street, but he couldn't see us, Bob's Hill being
in the way. By standing upon his one good foot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
he could see the village down below, and thought
he could make out the very house he lived in. He
was as hungry as a bear and his ankle seemed a
little better, although it was still swollen so much
that he couldn't get his shoe on and he couldn't
step on the foot.</p>

<p>He had plenty of food for breakfast, but he
didn't know how many meals he would need before
he could get away; so he ate only a little and waited,
hoping every minute that somebody would come
up on the mountain and find him.</p>

<p>When the day at last dragged around and the
sun was going down again in Hudson River, Bill
knew that he would have to spend another night
on the mountain and he felt pretty bad.</p>

<p>There were only a few mouthfuls of food left.
One bottle of water was all gone and the other
nearly so. He knew that by that time his folks
would feel sure that something had happened and
would begin to look for him. That was some
comfort.</p>

<p>Far down below, lights shone out from the
houses, one by one. Down there was his home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
One of those lights was shining out of his window,
shining for him, while his mother sat and waited&mdash;waited
for her boy who never would come back
again.</p>

<p>He sobbed aloud and stretched out his hands into
the darkness.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother," he whispered, "I wish I
hadn't come."</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning he was frightened
to find that the little food which he had saved for
his breakfast was gone. Some animal had stolen
it in the night.</p>

<p>His ankle was still badly swollen but it did not
pain him so much except when he tried to stand
on it.</p>

<p>He was hungry and looked around for something
that he could eat. A little below the edge of the
mountain stood a birch tree. He dragged himself
down to it and cut off long strips of the bark. This
he chewed for his breakfast, washing it down with
a few sips of water, which seemed hardly to wet
his parched throat.</p>

<p>"I'll crawl down to the spring, if I can, and die<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
there," he thought. "Maybe they will find me
sometime."</p>

<p>Then, as he was starting, something came to him.</p>

<p>Smoke signals! Perhaps one of the Scouts
would see them and know what they meant.</p>

<p>He was too weak and lame to spell out a message,
like we did on Bob's Hill. Instead, he built
two fires, throwing on grass and leaves to make
a thick smoke. There was no wind and the smoke
went straight up. That was one of the signals,
which Mr. Norton had taught us. It meant:</p>

<p>"I have lost the camp. Help."</p>

<p>He hadn't lost any camp, of course, but he didn't
know what else to send. He hoped it would let
us know where he was and that something had
happened.</p>

<p>All day long he tended his fires, his ankle aching
horribly because he had to move around so much.
Between times he sat on the mountain, looking
down at Bob's Hill and Plunkett's woods and the
village beyond, chewing birch bark and moistening
his lips with the few drops of warm water that
were left.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Late that afternoon he gave up and made up his
mind that he would crawl down to the spring before
dark and die there, he was so thirsty. He
turned to look down at his home, perhaps for the
last time, and to see Bob's Hill once more.</p>

<p>There were Plunkett's woods, and there, the twin
stones, like thimbles, they were so far away. And
there&mdash;what was that?</p>

<p>From the ground close to one of the stones, the
one where we build our fires, a great column of
smoke went up and he saw some things moving
around it, like flies or ants, they looked so small.
Then the column of smoke broke into long and
short puffs. It was a signal.</p>

<p>Slowly he spelled the words:</p>

<p>"I-S, Is; I-T, it; Y-O-U, you; B-I-L-L, Bill?"</p>

<p>Jumping to his feet, although he almost screamed
with pain, Bill grabbed his blanket and held it down
over one of the fires, which was still sending
out a big smoke; then pulled it off. Again and
again he sent up the puffs of smoke. His blanket
was blazing; his hands were burned to a blister;
he was almost strangled with the smoke; but Bill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kept on, until he had spelled out something which
could be seen from the top of Bob's Hill, far below:</p>



<div class='center'>

</table></div>


<p>Then he fainted away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOUND AT LAST<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN we saw the smoke signal on Greylock,
the first thing we thought of was to
signal back. But Skinny said:</div>

<p>"Come on. He won't be looking for us here.
Bob's Hill is the place. He can see us there."</p>

<p>We started on a run across the fields, getting
more excited every minute.</p>

<p>"I don't see how Bill could lose any camp," exclaimed
Benny.</p>

<p>"And I don't see what he is doing on Greylock
when he started for North Adams," Hank said.</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't Bill, at all," I told them. "I've
seen smoke on Greylock more than once."</p>

<p>"It's Bill all right," Skinny said. "I can almost
hear him. We don't know how he got there,
but he's there and he can't get back. Something
has happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, we'll soon find out," we all thought,
when we came in sight of the twin stones.</p>

<p>"I'll run down home and get a blanket,"
I told them, "while the rest of you make a
fire."</p>

<p>Our house is right at the foot of the hill and it
didn't take me long. The old horse blanket which
we used in signaling was in the woodshed. I only
stopped long enough to wet it and call to Ma that
Bill was up on Greylock signaling.</p>

<p>She was almost as excited as I was.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" said she. "Don't wait for me. I'll
come as soon as I can."</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of waiting for anybody.</p>

<p>She grabbed a pair of field glasses off the shelf
and rushed after me. I heard her calling to Mrs.
Blackinton when she went through the yard and
I had to go some to keep ahead.</p>

<p>By the time we had climbed the hill, the boys
had a big fire going and were piling on green
branches and leaves to make it smoke. Then we
caught hold of the blanket by the corners, ready
to shut off the smoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ask if it's Bill," Skinny told us, watching the
two smokes on the mountain.</p>

<p>Then we signaled, "Is it you, Bill?" and repeated
it. Before we had finished the second time
Skinny gave a shout.</p>

<p>"It's Bill," said he. "He's signaling."</p>

<p>We could see one column of smoke break up
into puffs, but couldn't see very plain because the
smoke was so thin and far away.</p>

<p>"Here, take this glass," said Ma, handing the
field glass to Skinny.</p>

<p>"Hurrah," he cried, after he had looked through
them. "I can see real good."</p>

<p>Then he held up one hand and we waited while
he called off the letters.</p>

<p>"H-E-L-P."</p>

<p>That was all. We waited for more but nothing
came.</p>

<p>Before we had turned to go Ma was halfway
down the hill and running to beat the band. I
knew that if Bill didn't get help it wouldn't be her
fault.</p>

<p>"See if you can get hold of Mr. Wilson,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
she called, as soon as we came in sight. "I'll
telephone his house. If you can't get him,
get somebody. Your father has gone to hitch
up and he will be ready to start in a few minutes."</p>

<p>In five minutes it seemed as if the whole town
knew about it and were out in front of our house,
or else climbing the hill to see the smoke. Mr.
Wilson came on a run and was in the wagon before
Pa could stop the horse.</p>

<p>"I want one of you boys to go with us," said
Pa. "We may need some more signaling. Benny
Wade, you are the lightest. Can you stand the
climb?"</p>

<p>"Can I?" said he. "You watch me."</p>

<p>The marshal chased up with a light stretcher and
another lantern.</p>

<p>"You can't have too many," he said. "It will
be dark before you get up there."</p>

<p>Ma came running out with a basket of bread
and butter and some meat.</p>

<p>"We'll light a big fire on the mountain, if all
is well," they told her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"The water!" called Skinny. "Pedro, get them
a big bottle."</p>

<p>In another minute they were off, while the others
went home to wait, which is the hardest part.</p>

<p>I found out afterward what happened. They
couldn't drive all the way up Greylock from our
side. There was a road from North Adams and
another from Cheshire but those were too far.</p>

<p>Pa planned to drive as far as they could and
then to leave the horse tied and walk up the rest
of the way. They went around the road by the
Quaker Meeting House to Peck's Falls. From
there a road goes part way up the mountain,
steep and winding. It was hard pulling for the
horse.</p>

<p>I don't believe Greylock ever was climbed so fast
before, although it seemed slow enough to poor
Bill waiting on top, thirsty and faint. He knew
that his signal had been seen and that was something.</p>

<p>The first thing that he heard was a call of a
crow, over to the south and far down the mountainside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Caw, caw, caw," came the sound, and it seemed
to be Benny's voice.</p>

<p>Bill stood up on one foot and listened.</p>

<p>"Caw, caw, caw," it came again, this time nearer.</p>

<p>Then Bill braced himself and seemed to grow
stronger, all in a minute.</p>

<p>"Caw," he yelled. "Caw, caw!"</p>

<p>The sound went floating down into the gathering
darkness, until it reached two men and a boy, toiling
up the mountainside.</p>

<p>"That's Bill!" cried Benny.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Mr. Wilson. "He's alive.
We know that."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he had Bill in his arms
and Benny was building the biggest fire that had
been seen on Greylock since I could remember.
We were watching for it down below and knew
that everything was all right.</p>

<p>"Now," said Pa, "let's have some supper.
I don't know about William, but I feel hungry."</p>

<p>It was late at night when they finally brought
Bill home. Mrs. Wilson nearly had a fit again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
when she saw them carrying him into the yard on
a stretcher.</p>

<p>"Speak to her, son," said his father, "so that
she will know you are alive."</p>

<p>Bill propped himself up on one elbow and gave
such a yell that it scared the neighbors, and ended
with a caw. Then she knew that it was all right
and felt better.</p>

<p>Skinny was the proudest fellow you ever saw
because we had found Bill. It made him real
chesty and we all felt good about it.</p>

<p>"Say, we're the stuff," said he. "If you don't
believe it, watch our smoke. That's all I've got to
say. Hurry up and get well, Bill, so we can have
a meeting and tell about our hikes. I want to see
a First Class Scout badge on my manly bosom."</p>

<p>We were sitting in Bill's house at the time, to
cheer him up a little because he couldn't go out
without a crutch.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with having the meeting
here?" said Bill. "I don't suppose Mr. Norton
will give me a badge because I haven't delivered
his message yet, but I'd like to hear what the rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of you did. I can't get out for a few days. When
I do, I'm going to North Adams and back, if it
takes a whole leg. Believe me."</p>

<p>"You did more than any of us," Benny told him,
"badge or no badge."</p>

<p>"I guess you won't chase over the mountain the
next time," I said. "When you stick to the roads
there don't anything happen."</p>

<p>"Oh, there don't, don't they?" exclaimed
Skinny. "Say, you fellers ought to have been with
me. There was something doing every minute.
Ma says it's a wonder that I'm alive. I've had
awfully hard work to keep from telling about it."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it now."</p>

<p>"Not much, you wouldn't be able to sleep to-night.
Besides, it might make Bill's ankle worse."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill. "There ain't anything
the matter with me, only it hurts me to step
on my foot. Come on, Skinny. Let's have it."</p>

<p>"No-p. We've got to have a meetin' first."</p>

<p>"Suppose that you have your meeting here to-night,"
said Mrs. Wilson, who had come into the
room in time to hear what we were talking about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"Willie is a great deal better and I can have him
take a nap to brace him for the story. If you boys
will come around after supper you can meet right
in this room, and perhaps, I don't say for sure,
perhaps the neighbors will bring in some ice cream
to quiet your nerves and make you sleep."</p>

<p>"May we bring Mr. Norton?" I asked. "He
is our Scoutmaster and he ought to be with us when
we tell about the doings of the patrol."</p>

<p>"Surely you can. He is coming, anyway. He
sent word this morning that he would call to-night."</p>

<p>We met at Skinny's a little before eight o'clock
and went over in a bunch. On the way Skinny told
us what to do.</p>

<p>"When we get to the gate," said he, "let's stop
and each one caw three times."</p>

<p>"What for?" I asked. "We know that he is
there; don't we? Besides Bill is sick. Maybe
we'd better keep quiet."</p>

<p>"Sick nothin'! He ain't any more sick than I
am. He said so himself. He's hurt his ankle a
little, that's all. Ankles can't hear, can they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe it will cheer him up to hear us," I told
him. "He can't get out, you know. It is hard
to be cooped up in the house that way, and Fourth
of July coming."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Benny, "let's not all caw at
once. We can take turns and it will not make so
much noise."</p>

<p>That was what we did, standing just outside
the gate, where we could see a light
streaming through an open window in Bill's
room.</p>

<p>Skinny led off with three. I followed, and the
others in turn, ending with Benny. Skinny said
that it sounded like the booming of minute guns
in some battle or other, that he read about in a
book.</p>

<p>Say, it surprised the folks living around there.
Before we were half through, they came running
out of their houses to see what was going on. It
made us feel proud and we were just going to do
it over again, when we heard Bill cawing in the
house and Mrs. Wilson threw the door open and
stood there laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I judge by the sound," said she, "that the
Ravens have arrived and are in good voice."</p>

<p>We found Bill sitting in a big chair, with his
foot propped up and his eyes shining.</p>

<p>At first we didn't know just how to act, until
in a few minutes Mr. Norton came and then Mrs.
Wilson brought in some ice cream and some clusters
of strawberries, with dishes of powdered sugar
to dip them into.</p>

<p>We knew how to act then, all right, and for a
few minutes we were too busy to talk.</p>

<p>I am not going to tell what all the Scouts did
on that hike. I already have told what happened
to some of us. There didn't much happen to most
of them, anyhow, any more than there did to me.
It was different with Skinny. Something almost
always happened to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A MAIDEN IN DISTRESS<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"FELLERS," Skinny had told us, when we
were getting ready to start on the hike,
"you always ought to carry a rope. Something
happens every time when you don't have a rope
along."</div>

<p>"It happens when you do," Benny said. "Anyhow,
a rope is too much bother. A blanket and a
frying pan and things like that are all I want to
carry."</p>

<p>"A rope is the thing, just the same. Didn't I
lasso the robber last summer out on Illinois River,
at Starved Rock? How could I lasso anything
without a rope? And didn't we let you down into
Horseshoe Canyon with a rope and pull Alice
What's-her-name up again?"</p>

<p>"Bet your life we did," Bill put in. "You need
a rope when you are camping out or are in a boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on the river, but what good is it in walking seven
miles?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it is and maybe it isn't; but, just the
same, you'll be sorry if you don't take one along."</p>

<p>He was right, too, for Bill told us afterward
that he would have given a good deal for a rope
when he was sitting on top of Greylock. He didn't
need it for anything, only, he said, it would have
been sort of company for him.</p>

<p>Skinny was bound to carry a rope. When he
marched down Center Street with it coiled around
his shoulders, over his blanket, and with his tomahawk
in his belt, people ran out of the stores to
look at him.</p>

<p>The road that he took is uphill a good part of
the way. It goes up through the foothills of the
east mountain and isn't easy walking. We slide
down that road sometimes in winter. When the
coasting is good we can slide nearly a mile, clear
into the village; then hitch on to a bob and ride
back again for another.</p>

<p>There were no bobs for Skinny. It was warm
in the sun and he loafed along, taking it easy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
looking for somebody to rescue. Once he stopped
to help a man in a field. Along about ten or eleven
o'clock he began to get hungry and tired. No matter
where he looked there didn't anything happen,
so he made up his mind to take a long rest the
next time he came to some good shade, and maybe
to cook his dinner.</p>

<p>A half-mile farther on he came to a real shady
spot by the roadside, under a tree which stood in
a corner of a pasture on the other side of a fence.
A tiny stream crossed the road, and ran down
through the pasture.</p>

<p>This was the place he had been looking for and,
after drinking, he threw himself down on the
ground and went to sleep.</p>

<p>He didn't know how long he slept but he felt
first rate when he woke up, only hungrier than ever.
Over in the pasture stood a cow with her back to
him, looking at something and growing real excited
about it.</p>

<p>"I wonder what ails the critter," said Skinny
to himself. "She looks mad about something,
snorting and shaking her head that way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then he heard a girl's voice singing. She
sang real loud, like boys whistle sometimes to keep
up their courage, when they are half scared. Then
in a few minutes she came in sight, walking across
the pasture and keeping one eye on the cow.</p>

<p>Skinny hadn't seen her before because the cow
had stood in the way.</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" said he. "Here's luck. She's
got a fire-red sunbonnet and cows don't like red
sunbonnets a little bit."</p>

<p>On came the girl, singing louder than ever, trying
to edge off away from the cow but not daring
to run.</p>

<p>Skinny could see that the cow was getting madder
all the time. He knew that something was
going to happen at last, and he began to uncoil his
rope.</p>

<p>"Run, you little fool," said he. "Run."</p>

<p>He meant the girl and not the cow. He said it
under his breath so she wouldn't hear, for he didn't
want to lose the chance to do the rescue act and
have something to tell us boys about afterward.</p>

<p>The girl was scared. Any one with half an eye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
could have seen that. The cow hadn't quite made
up its mind what to do, and Skinny was beginning
to be afraid that the girl would get across without
giving him a chance to get in his work. Then what
did she do but take off her sunbonnet and swing
it around by one string, just to let the cow know
that she wasn't afraid of any animal that walked
on four legs.</p>

<p>She hadn't seen Skinny yet, on account of his
being back of the cow. The cow didn't know he
was there, either, until about four seconds afterward.
It knew then, all right.</p>

<p>Maybe the cow wasn't mad when she saw that
red sunbonnet whirling around in the air. She tore
up the sod with her horns, gave a big snort, and
started, head down.</p>

<p>Say, it was Skinny's busy day about that time.
Before the cow could get fairly going he had
crawled under the fence and run up behind, whirling
his lasso around his head. Then he gave a
yell like a wild Indian and threw it.</p>

<p>I think the yell scared the girl worse than the
cow did. Anyhow, between the cow and the Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
she was scared stiff; just stood there paralyzed.
And she didn't do any more singing.</p>

<p>If that lasso had caught there would have been
a paralyzed cow all right. Skinny threw it in great
shape. It went straight for her horns, but when
he yelled she lifted her head suddenly. The loop
struck against one of the horns, instead of going
over it, and then fell off to the ground.</p>

<p>"Gee!" groaned Skinny. "Missed!"</p>

<p>There wasn't time to say anything more, and
he knew that he would have to get mighty busy
or there wouldn't be any rescuing done.</p>

<p>When something happens that way and you have
to do something first and think about it afterward,
the mind seems to work like chain lightning. There
was only one thing to do and it didn't take Skinny
long to do that. He dropped the rope, grabbed
hold of the cow's tail with both hands, and dug
his feet into the ground.</p>

<p>"Run!" he yelled. "Run for the fence! I've
got her."</p>

<p>When Bill heard about it he said that it seemed to
him as if the cow had Skinny. Anyhow, she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
surprised some and she was mad. She will think
twice next time before she does any chasing, when
anybody from Raven Patrol is around, I guess.</p>

<p>Skinny had a good hold and she couldn't get
away. First she stopped running and tried to get
at whatever it was back of her, with her horns,
chasing herself around in a circle.</p>

<p>Skinny hung on like a good fellow. He had to.
If he had let go once it would have been all up
with him. She never touched him. Every time
the cow stopped, there was a hundred pounds of
boy hanging to the end of her tail.</p>

<p>It was like playing crack the whip, he told us
afterward, "and being the littlest fellow on the tail
end."</p>

<p>Then for a few moments it was hard to tell
which was the cow and which was Skinny, for
she started on a run for the other side of the
pasture, Skinny sliding and bumping behind, and
both of them scared half to death. Skinny was
so excited he couldn't think to let go of the
tail.</p>

<p>Hank said that he would have given a quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
if he could have taken a picture of it with his
camera.</p>

<p>All this didn't take so long as it does to tell
about it. The girl had reached the fence, crawled
under, and was yelling for help.</p>

<p>Just then it seemed to Skinny as if the tail had
come off in his hands, for he went tumbling along,
heels over head, until he struck with a jar that
almost loosened his teeth.</p>

<p>What really happened was that he stumbled on
a stone and his hands were jerked loose. In another
minute the cow was out of sight in a hollow.
Skinny scrambled to his feet and went back after
the rope, trying not to limp because he could see
the girl looking at him through the fence.</p>

<p>He felt pretty chesty to think that he had rescued
a maiden, only he didn't know what to do with her,
now that he had saved her.</p>

<p>She spoke first, as he stood there sort of brushing
his clothes off.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, boy?"</p>

<p>"What, me?" said Skinny. "Me hurt? Say,
didn't you see the critter run when I got after her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say I did, only I was scared. Wasn't
you scared?"</p>

<p>"I don't scare worth a cent," he told her. "I
ain't afraid of any cow a-livin'. You don't suppose
I'd 'a' chased her all over the pasture, if I'd
been scared, do you?"</p>

<p>"N-no, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, if my lasso hadn't slipped, there would
have been something doing. It's lucky for you that
I got hold of her tail. That's the way to do it.
When you twist a cow's tail, it scares 'em."</p>

<p>It's just as Hank says, you never can tell what
a girl will do. That girl tried to say something;
then choked up and went off into a fit of laughing
that made the tears roll down her cheeks and left
her so weak that she had to hang on to the fence.</p>

<p>Skinny grinned a little to be polite, but he didn't
like it very well.</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, as soon as she could speak, "it
was too&mdash;too funny for anything to see you sailing
along behind the cow."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been so funny if the cow had
been running toward you, instead of away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
you. You would have laughed out of the other
side of your mouth, I guess."</p>

<p>She saw that he was mad about it.</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind my laughing," said she,
stuffing her handkerchief into her mouth. "I can't
help it. It's a disease."</p>

<p>"A disease?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's high strikes. When folks have them
they can't stop laughing. They laugh when they
ought to cry, maybe."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a ball game," said Skinny.</p>

<p>"It's something like that," she told him. "Maybe
that isn't it exactly but it's something. I'm
better now."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if it's something that ails you, I suppose
it's all right. I'd laugh, too, only I am all
out of breath from chasing the cow."</p>

<p>When he said that the girl burst out laughing
again, and Skinny laughed with her. That made
them feel acquainted.</p>

<p>"I guess I've got 'em, too," said he. "They
must be catching. Well, I must be going now."</p>

<p>"My name is Mary Richmond," she told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>,
"I live in Holyoke and I am visiting over where
you see that red barn."</p>

<p>"Mine is Gabriel Miller. I don't like the name
very well. Gabe isn't so bad. The boys call me
Skinny. I live down in the village and I am on
a hike. I guess I'd better be going now."</p>

<p>"I don't see any."</p>

<p>"Any what?"</p>

<p>"What you said you were on, a hike."</p>

<p>"You will see one in about a minute. I am out
for a long walk. I belong to the Boy Scouts and
I've got to walk seven miles, camp out to-night,
and come back to-morrow."</p>

<p>"My," said she, "you must be hungry&mdash;all that
walking and&mdash;and&mdash;chasing the cow, too."</p>

<p>"I am," said Skinny, bracing up. "I believe I'll
eat my lunch right here in the shade. Wish you'd
stay and eat with me. I can cook some bacon."</p>

<p>Wasn't that a nervy thing to say? Skinny is
brave when he gets started.</p>

<p>"It would be fine," she told him, "only Ma is
expecting me at the house. She is visiting, too.
Wouldn't it be nicer for you to come with me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
They will be glad to see you because you saved
me from the cow. I am awfully hungry and
Grandma is the best cook. We're going to have
lemonade. She told me so. Come on, do."</p>

<p>"Lemonade would taste good," he said, "if I
only dast."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said she, tossing her head. "I thought
that you were not afraid of anything."</p>

<p>"I ain't of a cow. This is different. Say, that
was a swell song you were singing. I wish I knew
it."</p>

<p>"I'll teach it to you after dinner, if you will
come. If you don't you're a 'fraid cat."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go if it kills me."</p>

<p>Skinny says that he never ate a dinner that
tasted any better than that one did. Mrs. Richmond
was scared when she heard about the cow
and she couldn't say enough about how he had
saved her little girl from a terrible death.</p>

<p>"That wasn't anything," he told her. "Scouts
are always doing those things. I'm going to try
to save somebody from drowning when I come
back along the river to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you a better stunt than that," said
Mary's grandfather, winking one eye at the rest
of the folks. "Why don't you go up to Savoy on
the east mountain. That would make a walk of
about seven miles from the village. You won't
find anybody drowning up there, but several deer
have been seen around there lately."</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Skinny, his eyes sticking out when
he thought of the deer. "If I only had a gun!"</p>

<p>"It's against Massachusetts law to shoot deer.
That's why they are getting so common. You
have your rope. Maybe you can lasso one. There
is no law against that, I guess."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," Skinny told him. "Bet your life
the boys will be surprised when they see me bringing
home a deer. Maybe I'll get two or three.
Mr. Norton didn't give me a message to anybody,
so it won't make any difference which way I
go."</p>

<p>"Don't get too many. We'd like to save a few.
And be careful that some bear doesn't get you,"
went on Mr. Richmond, laughing to see how excited
Skinny was. "They are not very common, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
once in a while one is seen on the mountain."</p>

<p>"How do you get up there?"</p>

<p>"Go back to Pumpkin Hook. It isn't far, and
then follow the road which turns east. It will take
you right to Savoy. You will find a pretty good
road all the way, and you won't have any more
trouble than you would going to Cheshire&mdash;unless,"
he added in a fierce voice that made Skinny jump,
"unless A BEAR GETS YOU!"</p>

<p>"Now, father, don't scare the boy to death,"
said Mary's mother. "You know well enough
there are no bears and the road to Savoy is a well-traveled
one."</p>

<p>"Of course it is, or I shouldn't have suggested
his going there. But there have been bears seen
on the Savoy Mountain. I saw one myself, last
year."</p>

<p>"Huh! I ain't afraid of no bear," put in
Skinny, drawing himself up and looking fierce.
"I tracked one once on Bob's Hill. It went up to
Peck's Falls and hid in our cave. We smoked it
out. I didn't have a gun or knife or anything, but
I hit it with a snowball."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>You could have hung a hat on Mary's eyes when
Skinny told them that.</p>

<p>"Was it a really and truly bear?" she asked.
"And did it stand on its hind legs like in the circus
pictures over at the Hook?"</p>

<p>"It stood on its hind legs, all right," he told
her, "but it wasn't really a bear. We thought it
was. It made tracks in the snow just like bear's
tracks, but when we had smoked it out we found
that it wasn't anything but a man."</p>

<p>"It was Jake Yost, a foolish feller," he explained,
turning to Mr. Richmond. "He had his boots on
the wrong feet and wouldn't change them back for
fear of changing his luck. That was what made
his tracks look like bear's tracks."</p>

<p>It tickled them to hear about that, but it didn't
tickle us boys much when it happened. It was too
scary.</p>

<p>"If you will stop here on your way back to-morrow,"
said Mary's grandma, "we'll give you
a nice dinner. I think you will be wanting one
about that time. Mary may walk with you as far
as the Hook, if you like, and show you the road."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think maybe I'd better go along, too, with
my gun," said Mr. Richmond, "on account of the
bears."</p>

<p>"Don't you mind his nonsense," she said. "You
run along."</p>

<p>So off they went together, Skinny with his rope
and tomahawk and Mary with her red sunbonnet,
but they kept away from the pasture.</p>

<p>From Pumpkin Hook Skinny went on alone, up
the mountain road, whirling his tomahawk around
his head and every little while pretending to lasso
the enemy, because he knew that Mary was watching
him from below.</p>

<p>Then pretty soon he came to a bend in the road.
He turned and waved to her, and in a minute was
out of sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TREED BY A BEAR<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp; AM writing what happened to Skinny as if
we found out all about it at once, which we
didn't. He told us some of it the first time, with
Bill sitting up and listening and Mr. Norton asking
questions whenever Skinny began to run down.
But every time we saw him after that for several
days he would think of something more to tell, or
something a little different, so that it took a long
time before we felt sure that we knew all about it.</div>

<p>For instance, he didn't say much at first about
Mary Richmond, the Holyoke girl, except the rescue
part. He was afraid that the boys would make
fun of him for walking down the mountain with
a girl&mdash;but I haven't told about that yet. I am
going to put everything in just when it happened,
so that you can understand it better.</p>

<p>There didn't much happen, anyhow, while he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was going up to Savoy. The road was steep and
winding, and climbing it kept Skinny busy and
made him wish more than once that he had gone
in some other direction.</p>

<p>What Mr. Richmond had said about bears made
him nervous. Every time he saw a stump of a
tree, he was sure it was a bear, and every time he
came to a part of the woods where the trees stood
very close together and it looked dark inside, he
had to whistle and sing louder than Mary did when
she was afraid of the cow.</p>

<p>Whenever he felt real scared he would caw like
a crow, and that made him feel almost brave again,
for sometimes when you just pretend you are brave
and act as if you are, all of a sudden you get brave.
I don't know why it is but I have noticed it.</p>

<p>He kept a sharp eye out for deer, for he wanted
to bring us one, but he didn't see a thing all the
way up that looked like a wild animal except a
calf, which ran when he threw a stick at it, and the
birds, which don't count.</p>

<p>It was hot work but the air was fine, and he
could see all up and down Hoosac Valley, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
is worth seeing any time. If he had taken a spy-glass
with him, perhaps he could have seen the
other Scouts on the way to North Adams and
Cheshire.</p>

<p>Once in a while he came to a mountain brook,
gurgling and singing over the stones. Then he
would throw himself down to rest and listen to
the pouring water, which we boys think is the
sweetest music in all the world, unless it is the
cawing of a crow away off somewhere, on the
mountainside.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he came to Savoy and
stopped in a field to cook himself a good supper.</p>

<p>That night he slept in a barn, cuddling down in
the haymow, where he could hear some horses
stirring in their stalls. They seemed sort of like
company for him, although they couldn't talk
any.</p>

<p>"Were you not afraid up there, all alone?" Mr.
Norton asked, when Skinny was telling about the
horses.</p>

<p>"What, me?" said he. "Anyhow, I wouldn't
have been, only there were all kinds of noises in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the night and once I heard something scratching at
the door. I think it was a bear; maybe, two
bears."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill, and we all thought
so, too. But Skinny waved one hand, as if that
wasn't anything worth mentioning, and went on.</p>

<p>When morning finally came and the sun shone
in through a cobwebby window across the haymow
he slipped out of the barn on the side away from
the house, so that the folks wouldn't see him.</p>

<p>Just the same, they saw him cooking his breakfast,
and were going to set the dog on him. But
when the farmer's wife found out that it was a
Boy Scout and not a tramp she told him to come
right into the house and eat with them. He went,
too, because he could smell the breakfast cooking
and it 'most made him crazy.</p>

<p>"How about it, Mr. Norton?" said Bill. "That
makes two meals Skinny had given to him, not
counting the dinner at Richmond's the next day,
which he hasn't told about yet. That makes three.
Didn't he have to cook them himself on account of
the Scout business?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Mr. Norton could answer Skinny spoke
up.</p>

<p>"Aw, g'wan!" said he. "I cooked enough to
make up for it, I guess. Why, I stopped two or
three times and cooked something. You don't suppose
a feller can climb mountains without eatin',
do you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't eat much," said Bill with a grin, "but
I wanted to."</p>

<p>"I think Gabriel is right," laughed Mr. Norton.
"Besides it sometimes is harder to work folks for
a meal than it is to cook it, yourself."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Skinny told him, "I didn't get to
Richmond's in time for that dinner and I paid for
those other meals. I rescued the girl the first time,
didn't I? That ought to be good for a dinner.
And to pay for my breakfast I carried in a lot of
wood for the farmer's wife. She liked it so well
that she said she would be glad to have me stay
to dinner. There wasn't any chance to do any
rescuing in Savoy, so I had to do something
else."</p>

<p>"That's business!" exclaimed Mr. Norton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
"Pay as you go. Gabriel, my boy, you showed
yourself a true Scout and I'm proud of you."</p>

<p>He reached over and fastened a First Class Scout
badge to Skinny's coat.</p>

<p>"Maybe I am a little ahead of the game," said
he, "but Gabriel is leader and I think that he has
earned a badge. This seems to be the psychological
moment to present it."</p>

<p>Benny spoke up before we could stop him.</p>

<p>"What's a skological moment?" said he.</p>

<p>Say, that stumped Mr. Norton. He couldn't
tell us.</p>

<p>"I'd like very much to give you one, William,"
he went on, after a little, turning to Bill. "You
showed yourself a hero and you have done everything
except the hike. How would it do to give
you the badge now, with the understanding that
you will make good on the hike later, when you
get well?"</p>

<p>Skinny swelled all up when Mr. Norton gave
him the badge, and I guess anybody would. He
didn't know what to do or say at first, but in a
minute he came to his senses. He jumped to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
feet and gave the Scout salute. It was great to
see him.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said he, turning to us with his arms
folded, while Mr. Norton looked on, wondering
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"Who are going to be the best Boy Scouts in
America, or England, either?"</p>

<p>"We are!" we shouted.</p>

<p>"Who is the best Scoutmaster that ever happened?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Norton!" we yelled.</p>

<p>"Who is great stuff, if he did sprain his ankle
on Greylock?"</p>

<p>"Bill Wilson!"</p>

<p>"'Tis well. Everybody caw. Now!"</p>

<p>There was some racket around that room when
we turned ourselves loose. Bill sat there smiling
and with his face all flushed up, he was so tickled
over what Mr. Norton and Skinny had said.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Norton pulled another badge out of
his pocket and started to pin it on Bill's clothes.
Bill stopped him.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair, Mr. Norton," said he. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
started out to do my hike and I didn't do it. I
know that I did something which was harder but
I didn't do that. I wouldn't feel right about wearing
the badge until after I had made good."</p>

<p>"What do you say, boys?" asked Mr. Norton,
his eyes shining because he was so proud of Bill.</p>

<p>"Bill's all right," said Hank. "We all know
that he can do the stunt and that he will do it,
but he hasn't done it yet."</p>

<p>Then Benny spoke up.</p>

<p>"Guess what!" said he. "Let's all wait until
Bill gets well and does it, before getting our badges.
Except Skinny; he's got his."</p>

<p>"Bet your life I'll wait, too," said Skinny.</p>

<p>He started to take the badge off, but we wouldn't
let him.</p>

<p>"Forget it," said Bill, "and go on with the
story. You stopped in an interesting place. I
don't believe much happened, anyhow, except the
cow, and you've told us about that."</p>

<p>"I don't like to tell the rest. It will make you
walk in your sleep and that will hurt your foot.
But I'm willing to risk it if you are."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>You see, when Skinny started toward home from
Savoy, he made up his mind that he would lasso
a deer, or know the reason why, because it would
look fine to have one stuffed and standing in front
of our cave at Peck's Falls. So, when he had
found a place that looked wild and sort of scary,
he left the road and, getting his rope in shape to
throw, made his way in through the brush, as
still as he could, so as not to frighten the deer
away.</p>

<p>He didn't see any deer, but after a while he
found a big patch of wild strawberries, so thick
he couldn't step without tramping on some. That
made him forget all about his deer for 'most an
hour.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, he heard a crackling in
the bushes on the other side of a clearing, and
he felt sure that his chance had come.</p>

<p>Skinny dropped on his hands and knees and
crawled toward the sound. It was slow work because
he had to be careful not to make any noise,
and he grew more excited every moment.</p>

<p>At last he was crouching down behind some big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
bushes, and on the other side he could hear the deer
real plain, tramping around like a horse.</p>

<p>"Gee!" thought he. "It's a big one and will
look great up by our cave."</p>

<p>He didn't say it out loud because he knew that
although the deer could not smell him on account
of the wind blowing the other way, he would hear
him, unless he was very careful.</p>

<p>Then, getting the rope ready to throw, with the
slip noose working easily, he parted the bushes
gently and crept through.</p>

<p>There was a great crashing as some big animal
broke his way through the bushes in front of him.
Then came a snarl and a growl that made Skinny's
heart almost stop beating. And there he stood,
paralyzed, looking straight into the eyes of a
bear!</p>

<p>It wasn't any Jake Yost with his boots on wrong,
either. It was the real thing, looking as big as
the Quaker Meeting House to Skinny, although it
was really only a cub, about half grown.</p>

<p>I guess the bear wasn't expecting anybody to
call, for he stood there, sort of paralyzed himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his eyes looking right into Skinny's and one big
paw raised to take another step.</p>

<p>Skinny gave a howl and started for the nearest
tree, one that was too small for a bear to climb.</p>

<p>Say, if tree climbing had been one of the Scout
stunts, Skinny would have won two badges.</p>

<p>It isn't any fun to sit in a tree on a mountain,
with a real live bear sniffing around at the bottom
and you both getting hungrier every minute.</p>

<p>Skinny knew he was safe as long as he stayed
in the tree, but he didn't dare get down while the
bear was in sight, and the cub wouldn't go away
more than a few rods. I guess Skinny looked good
to him, he was so fat.</p>

<p>Dinner time came and went. He was still in
the tree and the bear was still fooling around below.</p>

<p>Skinny called for help until he was hoarse, but
there wasn't anybody passing at that time of day.
Then he began to get mad, and when Skinny gets
mad, look out!</p>

<p>"You think you're smart," said he, "but old
Long Knife will show you a thing or two."</p>

<p>First he let down his rope and found that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
would reach the ground. Then he fixed the noose
up in good shape, tied the other end around a limb
and waited.</p>

<p>By and by the bear came smelling around that
rope to see what it was, and that was exactly what
Skinny had been waiting for. He leaned down and
tried to swing the noose over the cub's head. The
bear didn't know what to make of it and every
time the rope would hit his nose he would growl
and strike it away with his paw.</p>

<p>Skinny saw that he would have to get closer.
He climbed down to a lower limb; then held on
with one hand, swung out over the bear, and tried
to lasso him with the other.</p>

<p>He almost did it, too, but just as he leaned still
farther down, all of a sudden there was a cracking
noise and the limb broke.</p>

<p>With an awful scream of despair, Skinny fell.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BEAR<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE Band, I mean the Ravens, don't know so
very much about bears. That was the only
bear we ever had come across and we had been
berrying all over those mountains, although mostly
on the Greylock side. Pa says that they usually
keep away from the road, the few that are left,
because they are afraid of folks.</div>

<p>Anyhow, it isn't any picnic to fall out of a tree
at any time, especially when there is a bear at
the bottom.</p>

<p>When the limb began to crack, Skinny knew that
he was a goner. He yelled so loud that it surprised
the bear and it looked up into the tree to see what
was going on. Just at that second the leader of
Raven Patrol landed on the cub's nose, like a thousand
of brick. Boy and bear both went sprawling,
one in one direction and the other in another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Skinny was the first to get on his feet and the
way he shinned up the tree again was a caution.
He didn't stop to look until he had reached the
limb where the rope was tied. Then he felt safe.</p>

<p>The bear had picked himself up and was standing
close to the foot of the tree, looking up and
whining, as if he didn't like being hit in the head
by a boy very well.</p>

<p>It was the chance which Skinny had been waiting
for. He gathered the rope up in his hands and
opened the noose wide. Then, leaning down as far
as he dared, until he was right over the bear, he
dropped it. The noose fell as straight as a die and,
spreading out around the cub's head, lay across
his shoulders with the side nearest the tree almost
touching the ground.</p>

<p>Just as the bear stepped one foot over the loop,
Skinny grabbed the rope with both hands and gave
a quick jerk. The noose tightened; and there was
the most surprised bear you ever saw, tied fast to
the tree! Skinny stood on the limb above like a
big crow, cawing to beat the band and so excited
that he came near falling again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee, but that bear was mad," said Skinny, when
he was telling us about it. "He growled and he
snapped and he rolled on the ground; then he ran
around and around the tree, until he had wound
himself up short, but he couldn't get away. It was
great, only I didn't dare jump on him again. He
was too crazy."</p>

<p>"Great snakes, Skinny!" exclaimed Bill. "You
always have all the fun."</p>

<p>"I guess you wouldn't have thought it so much
fun if you had been up in the tree and couldn't
get down. I'd 'a' choked him with the rope, if
he hadn't got his feet tangled up in it so that I
couldn't."</p>

<p>"How did you get down, Skinny?" asked Benny,
because Skinny had a way of stopping at the most
interesting places and pretending that he was
through telling about it.</p>

<p>In order to tell about that I'll have to go back
a little in this history.</p>

<p>When Mr. Richmond told Skinny to go up to
Savoy and to be careful not to let the bears get
him, he was trying to scare a Boy Scout. He says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that he hadn't any idea there would be a bear or
deer around, or he shouldn't have let him go. But
the next morning a man from Savoy drove past
the house and told about seeing a bear on the way
down. He didn't have his gun along and besides
the bear ran into the woods when he saw him.</p>

<p>That made Mr. Richmond feel uneasy.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't let the boy go up the mountain,"
he said. "I don't suppose anything will
happen to him, but I'd feel better if he hadn't gone.
I guess, of the two, the bear would be the most
scared if they should meet."</p>

<p>"He told me that he'd surely come in time for
dinner," said Mary.</p>

<p>When dinner time came she put a plate on for
him. He didn't show up, of course. He was up
in the tree about that time, wondering how he ever
would get down. After that Mr. Richmond grew
real anxious and went to the house several times
to see if Skinny had come.</p>

<p>"That boy looked to me," he said at last, "as
if he wouldn't be guilty of missing a good dinner
if he could help it. I am going after him. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
may be all right, but I'm going to find out for
sure."</p>

<p>With that, he hitched up a horse, took down his
gun, and started.</p>

<p>"Let me go, too," Mary called after him. "I
can hold the horse while you are looking."</p>

<p>"All right. Jump in. We'll probably meet him
on the road somewhere."</p>

<p>The first they saw or heard of him was the yell
which Skinny gave when the limb broke. It scared
them.</p>

<p>"Take the reins," said Mr. Richmond. "There
is trouble over there. Turn around and if anything
comes run the old horse down the road."</p>

<p>Say, he was paralyzed, when he found the bear
tied to a tree and Skinny standing on a limb, cawing.</p>

<p>"I was that flabbergasted," said he afterward,
"that I hardly could pull the trigger."</p>

<p>But he pulled it, all right, and that was the end
of Mr. Bear.</p>

<p>Skinny didn't like it because Mr. Richmond killed
the bear. He wanted to tame it and give a show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in our barn. He was bound to take it home, anyhow,
so as to save the skin.</p>

<p>It took a lot of pulling and hauling to get the
cub out to the road, and Mary had to help before
they could lift him into the wagon.</p>

<p>"Jump in," said Mr. Richmond, when everything
was ready. "It is time that I was getting home."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Skinny. "You see, I am doing
a stunt for the Scouts and I have to walk."</p>

<p>Just before they started Mary thought of something.</p>

<p>"Say," said she, "maybe I'd walk, too, if anybody
asked me; that is, if Grandpa would let me
and it wouldn't make any difference with the
Scouts."</p>

<p>"Come on, do," said Skinny. "May she, Mr.
Richmond?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "seein' as how you've got a
rope and it ain't very far, I'm willin'. But it will
be mighty lonesome for me."</p>

<p>I never saw Skinny so chesty as he was over
catching that bear. And he had a right to be, for
everybody was talking about it and there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
long piece in the paper. He even wanted to change
the name of Raven Patrol to the Bears, but we
wouldn't stand for that. We didn't know how to
make a noise like a bear, anyway.</p>

<p>After that the folks told us to keep away from
Savoy Mountain, rope or no rope, and we had
to do it. But Skinny wanted to go back and get
a bear for each of us.</p>

<p>"I think that our patrol leader has made good,"
said Mr. Norton, when Skinny had finished.
"What I'm wondering is, who was the most
frightened, Gabriel or the bear?"</p>

<p>"The bear was," said Skinny; "anyhow, after
I jumped on him. Say, I'll bet you fellers wouldn't
dast jump on a live bear, when he was growling
and showing his teeth. It was great, just like
jumping on a cushion, only the bear didn't like it
very well."</p>

<p>The other boys didn't have much to tell, much
that was exciting, I mean, but Mr. Norton made
us all report what we did. Hank came last
of all.</p>

<p>"Well, Henry," said Mr. Norton, "what have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
you to say for yourself? You went to Cheshire
by the river road, I believe?"</p>

<p>"How about that new invention, Hank?" I
asked. I'd forgotten all about it until then.</p>

<p>"Have you a new invention, Henry? Tell us
about it."</p>

<p>"'Tain't nothin'," said Hank, squirming in his
chair. "It didn't work just right. I guess I'll
have to go home now. Ma said to get in by ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"We'll have time for your report," Mr. Norton
told him.</p>

<p>Hank kept nudging me, trying to get me to go
with him, but I wouldn't do it, so after a while he
began.</p>

<p>You see his invention, the one he spoke to me
about just before we started, was a Life Saver.
When we were learning to be Scouts Mr. Norton
taught us how to bring drowned people back to
life again; that is, if they haven't been in the water
too long. What Hank wanted to do was to invent
something that would keep them from getting
drowned in the first place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all right to bring them to life," he told
me, "but it would be a heap better not to have
'em drown at all."</p>

<p>After doing a lot of thinking, he made a sort
of balloon of oiled silk, with the mouth fastened
to a hollow reed and a piece of potato to put over
the end of the reed, instead of a cork. Hanging
from the mouthpiece were two pieces of stout cord.</p>

<p>"What's it for, Hank?" asked Skinny, when
he was showing it to us. "It looks like a bagpipe."</p>

<p>"It's a Life Saver," he said. "You carry it
in your pocket when the air is out of it and look
along the river until you find somebody drowning.
Then you throw him the Life Saver, if he hasn't
got one in his own pocket. He ties it around his
neck, puts the mouthpiece to his lips, and blows
the bag full of wind. Then he puts the potato on
the end to keep the air from leaking out. He can't
sink, can he? The balloon will hold him up."</p>

<p>"Great snakes, Hank!" said Bill. "You've got
a great head&mdash;like a tack."</p>

<p>"A tack's head is level, just the same."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess what," said Benny. "Let's go swimming
up to the Basin, to-morrow, and try it."</p>

<p>"We can go swimming if we want to," Hank
told him, "but I did try it. It worked and it
didn't work."</p>

<p>"What's the answer?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I walked all the way to Cheshire
Harbor, looking for a chance to use the Life Saver
and I couldn't find anybody even in swimming, let
alone drowning. The water isn't deep enough for
drowning in most places, anyhow. But when I
got to Cheshire Harbor I found a kid sitting on
the bank of the race, fishing.</p>

<p>"'What you got?' he asked, when he saw me
fooling with the Life Saver.</p>

<p>"'Jump in,' I said, after I had told him about
it. 'I'll show you how it works.'</p>

<p>"'Jump in yourself,' he said. 'I don't want to
get my feet wet. Let's see the old thing, anyway.'</p>

<p>"I handed it to him and he blew up the bag until
I thought it would bust, and then tied it on with
the strings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Say, that's great stuff,' said he. 'I'll bet it
will work all right.'</p>

<p>"When he said that, I don't know why I did it,
but it seemed as if I couldn't help it. I felt as if I
just had to save him. I pushed him in, balloon
and all."</p>

<p>"Gee-e-ewhilikens!" shouted Skinny.</p>

<p>"You mutt!" said Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was too surprised to say anything,
but he had the funniest look on his face.</p>

<p>"Did it work?" Benny asked.</p>

<p>"It worked all right, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" I said, beginning to get mad because
Hank kept stopping at the most interesting
parts.</p>

<p>"He had tied it on to one ankle, instead of
around his neck. It made his ankle float, but his
head went under, and he couldn't swim. I rescued
him, but I had to jump in after him and pull
him out. It was hard work because he kept trying
to hit me all the time. Then, after I'd got
him out, I had to lick him before he would let me
go on and do my stunt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hardly think that was according to Scout
law," said Mr. Norton, when the rest of us had
finished laughing and pounding Hank on the
back.</p>

<p>"I rescued somebody, just the same. Only it
wasn't a maiden."</p>

<p>"We still have a few minutes," said Mr. Norton.
"Suppose that we play a new game which I have
here. It is a kind of invention of my own and
is called baseball."</p>

<p>"Seems as if I'd heard of that game somewhere,"
said Skinny, poking me in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Not this one. This is parlor baseball and is
brand new," replied the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>He brought out a chart, marked off in squares
to represent different plays, and laid it flat on the
floor, about six inches from the wall, at the end of
the room.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "we'll choose sides, then stand
off about ten feet and toss silver dollars at the
squares. That is the same as going to bat. I mention
silver dollars because I brought some with me.
Any disk, or ring, about the same size and weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would do as well and might be more convenient.
The square on which the disk rests gives the result
of your play. If the disk rolls off the chart it
counts as a strike, and three strikes are out. Usually
the Scoutmaster or Scout leader acts as umpire,
calls off each play as made and keeps the score.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
To-night, however, as William is not able to play,
we will make him umpire and I will take part in
the game to make even sides."</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="game squares">
<tr><td align='center'>HOME RUN</td><td align='center'>STRIKE</td><td align='center'>THREE BASE<br />HIT</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>FLY<br />CATCH</td><td align='center'>BATTER<br />HIT</td><td align='center'>OUT ON<br />FIRST</td></tr>

<tr><td align='center'>FOUL</td><td align='center'>PASS<br />BALL</td><td align='center'>BALK</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>"Let me illustrate," he went on. "We will suppose
that the first man up throws three disks and
all of them roll off the chart. That counts as
three strikes and he is out. The second player may
throw a two-bagger or a single. He then returns
to his seat and the third player, by throwing a
three-bagger, brings the second man home and gains
third base for himself. The runners are advanced
each time as many bases as the batter makes. They
also are advanced one base by a pass ball, a fly
catch or an out-on-first. The first two fouls count
as strikes, of course, and four balls entitle the batter
to first base. The arrangement of these squares
is important. The home run is guarded on three
sides by strikes and in front by a fly catch. The
three-base hit is as carefully guarded."</p>

<p>"Say, that game is all right," said Skinny, after
we had finished playing. "Three caws for Mr.
Norton, our 'stinguished and celebrated Scoutmaster."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he could make himself heard, Bill
spoke up.</p>

<p>"I think the secretary," said he, "ought to put
how to play that game in the minutes of the
meetin'."</p>

<p>"There ain't goin' to be any," I told him. "It's
too much work."</p>

<p>"I think that William's suggestion is a good
one," Mr. Norton said, "and I also appreciate the
force of your secretary's objection. How would it
be if I should do the work? I'll have typewritten
copies of the rules of the game struck off, so that
each of you can have one."</p>

<p>That is what he did, the very next day. I am
going to put the rules into this history right here,
just as he wrote them, because other Scouts may
want to play the game.</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Scouts' Parlor Baseball.&mdash;Rules for Play.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Divide the patrol into two equal groups and
arrange them in batting order on opposite sides
of the room. Place the baseball chart six or eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
inches from one end of the room on the floor and
indicate a mark ten feet from the chart for the
"batter" to stand on. The Scouts having their
inning then take turns at tossing a silver dollar (another
metallic disk or ring of equal size will suffice)
at the chart. Each player's record at bat is told by
the square on which the dollar rests, off the chart
entirely counting as a strike. If the dollar rests
squarely across a line it is tossed again.</p>

<p>The rules of baseball govern the game. After a
player finishes his turn, he takes position at the
farther end of his side, and the next in line takes
his turn, thus preserving the batting order. When
three players have been declared out, that side is
retired and the other side takes its inning. If
time permits, a nine-inning game is played; otherwise
the number of innings to be played should be
decided before beginning.</p>

<p>When a "batter" wins a position on a base he
is advanced at each play as many bases as the next
player earns at the "bat." He also advances one
base on out-on-first, fly-catch, balk, and pass-ball
plays, and when forced. He must keep track of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
his supposed position on the bases and report to
the official when making a score.</p>

<p>The official, usually the patrol leader or Scoutmaster,
decides the plays and tosses the dollars
back to the players. He also keeps the score, and
may correct a player, if necessary, for being noisy,
or for leaving his seat when not playing. In fact,
he is in control of the game, but is not allowed
to play except when there is present an odd number
without him.</p>

<p>The chart should be made of stiff paper so as
to lie flat on the floor, or of cloth, in order to be
tacked down. Each square should be 9 x 9 inches,
but a smaller size may be used if the room is not
large. In that case the players should stand less
than ten feet from the chart. The squares must
be labeled as in the diagram. Young Scouts, or
beginners, are sometimes allowed to stand eight, or
even six, feet from the chart, in order to make the
sides more equal. This and any other questions
that may arise are decided by the official.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EAGLE PATROL JOINS THE SCOUTS<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>YOU must not think, when you read this history,
that something all the time was happening
to us Scouts. I am only telling about what
did happen. Pa says that when it comes to starting
things we have them all beaten to a frazzle and Ma
told us that it would be a mercy if we ever lived
to grow up, without losing any of our hands or
feet. But we don't think so. Boys have to be
doing something all the time, don't they? If they
didn't they would get into mischief.</div>

<p>Anyhow, there didn't much of anything happen
after Skinny lassoed the bear, for a long time,
unless you count the Fourth of July. Nobody
can help having the Fourth of July. It's part of
the year. It is for our country.</p>

<p>One Fourth of July, long ago, even before Pa
was born, they rang old Liberty Bell in Philadelphia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to beat the band, and they fired off guns.
'Cause why? 'Cause there was a paper signed on
that day, which said that the United States of
America should be free and independent. But
England was like old Pharaoh, with the Hebrew
children, that the Bible tells about. They didn't
want to let us go. I don't blame them much for
it, either, but Skinny does.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I guess God must have meant for us
to go free, just as He did the Children of Israel
because, although England was the greatest Nation
in the world and the best one, too, it seems to me,
and we were only a few scattering colonies without
much money or anything, we came out ahead.
That is why Skinny thinks that George Washington
could have licked Napoleon Bonaparte with one
hand tied behind his back.</p>

<p>So we have the Fourth of July, and we boys ring
the church bells at four o'clock in the morning,
when they don't catch us at it, just like old Liberty
Bell was rung so many years ago.</p>

<p>One of Skinny's ancestors was killed in the battle
of Bunker Hill. That is what makes him so fierce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
against the Britishers. Every Fourth of July he
has us go up on Bob's Hill or somewhere and fight
the battle all over again.</p>

<p>The time I am telling about we built a fire on
the hill and rang the church bells and fired off
firecrackers until we were tired and half starved;
then went home to breakfast. Everybody promised
to meet again at my house about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Soon after nine we all were sitting on our side
steps, talking over where we should go for our
battle, when Skinny happened to stand up and look
down the street.</p>

<p>We heard him make a noise like a snake and he
dropped off the steps to the ground so quickly that
we thought at first he had a fit or something, until
he made a motion for us to follow him and began
to crawl toward the fence.</p>

<p>We didn't know what the matter was, but knew
that it was something important, so we crawled
along after him as fast as we could. When we
reached the pickets he pointed and we peeped over
the top, careful not to let more than our eyes be
seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>What we saw was three members of the Gingham
Ground Gang coming up the street, walking in the
middle of the road and looking on both sides as
they came, as if they were expecting trouble and
wanted to be ready for it.</p>

<p>Two of them had red shirts, and that made
Skinny mad because it made him think of his
ancestor who was killed at Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>"The Redcoats are coming," said he in a hoarse
whisper, so that they wouldn't hear, but fierce-like,
just the same. "Wait until you can see the whites
of their eyes; then, 'charge, the ground's your own,
my braves. Will ye give it up to slaves? Hope
ye mercy, still?'"</p>

<p>It was a part of his last day piece at school and
sounded fine.</p>

<p>"Charge nothin'!" said Bill. "The Americans
didn't do any charging at Bunker Hill, I guess.
The Britishers did the charging. The Americans
waited behind a fence until they got near enough
and then let 'em have it, until their ammunition
gave out. Then they ran. That's what they did."</p>

<p>That was true, too, but, just the same, it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
victory to hold the hill as long as their powder
lasted, and Bill knew it, but he liked to get Skinny
mad.</p>

<p>"Bill Wilson," said Skinny, "you are a nice
patriot! You are a Scout and a half; that's what
you are&mdash;not! So are we going to run but, bet
your life, we're going to run toward the enemy.
If you want to stay here behind the fence you can
do it. The rest of us are going to charge."</p>

<p>Bill gave me a thump in the ribs and grinned,
but didn't say anything. I saw Benny whisper
something, his eyes shining with excitement; then
Skinny motioned to us what to do.</p>

<p>Each of us lighted a firecracker and held it with
the fuse sputtering and sizzling, until they were
almost opposite. Then we threw the crackers
under their feet. They went off like a volley of
musketry. At the same time we gave a great caw
and jumped the fence.</p>

<p>"Give it to 'em, fellers," yelled Skinny. "These
are the guys that wanted to duck Benny in the mill
pond."</p>

<p>Say, it was great. The firecrackers surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them, for they hadn't seen us, and we were over
the fence and upon them before they could run.
Things were lively in Park Street for a few minutes.
Then, all of a sudden, we heard a man's
voice say:</p>

<p>"Scouts, attention!"</p>

<p>And there was Mr. Norton, looking surprised
and sorry!</p>

<p>We all stood up with a jerk and saluted, and
the Gingham Ground boys started to run. They
only went a few steps, however, and then waited
to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"Scouts," said Mr. Norton, sternly, "what sort
of brawl is this, on the Fourth of July?"</p>

<p>He was looking at Skinny, he being Scout leader.</p>

<p>"'Tain't a brawl," said Skinny. "It's the battle
of Bunker Hill; that's what it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is, is it? On which side are you Scouts
fighting?"</p>

<p>"We are Americans, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, if I remember my history right, in that
battle a little handful of Americans faced the British
soldiers and held them back until their powder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
gave out. And here the American army seems to
be attacking a handful of British."</p>

<p>"That's what I told him," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Skinny, "those guys tried to
duck Benny that time when he was coming home
from his long hike. So we thought that we would
duck them in the race. Didn't they try to duck
you, Benny?"</p>

<p>Benny nodded.</p>

<p>"How about Scout law?" asked Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>"Scout law doesn't say we mustn't duck our enemies."</p>

<p>"It does, too," Bill told him. "It says that we
must be kind to animals."</p>

<p>That was a hot one and it made us all laugh.</p>

<p>"How much more should we be kind one to
another," said Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't very kind to duck Benny," insisted
Skinny.</p>

<p>"No, and they didn't do it. If I have been correctly
informed, they let Benny go because John
here was kind to a dumb animal."</p>

<p>That was true and I said so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even if they had ducked him, don't you think
that it would be better to heap 'coals of fire' upon
their heads?"</p>

<p>It surprised Benny to hear Mr. Norton talk like
that.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't do such a thing," said he. "Besides,
we haven't got any hot coals."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have," laughed Mr. Norton. "The
'hot coals' I mean are kind words and kind actions.
What I meant to say was that you should return
good for evil and then your kind words would
make those boys feel as if you were putting coals
of fire on their heads."</p>

<p>"I don't believe we ought to do it," Skinny told
him, "if it is going to hurt that bad."</p>

<p>"Suppose we try it and see. I think perhaps it
will not be quite so painful."</p>

<p>"Boys," said he, turning to the Gingham Ground
bunch just as they were starting away. "I have
organized these eight village lads into a patrol of
the Boy Scouts of America and we have planned
to have a campfire this evening on Bob's Hill.
These Scouts of mine mean all right. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
simply working off a little misdirected patriotism.
Now, what we want, is for you to meet with us,
you and the rest of the Gang. Will you do
it?"</p>

<p>They didn't want to at first.</p>

<p>"There are Boy Scouts," he went on, "in all
parts of the civilized world; in England, too,
Gabriel, as well as in this country, and the Law
says that all Scouts are brothers to every other
Scout. There are a half million in the United
States alone. I have been appointed Scoutmaster
for this district and I want to organize one or two
more patrols so that I can have a troop. I have
had you boys in mind ever since you so nobly
turned out to help find William, the time he was
hurt on Greylock. It will be much the same as the
Gang, only better. You can keep the same leader
if you wish, and I know a man who will buy
uniforms for you all. Will you come to-night so
that we can talk it over? What do you say?"</p>

<p>The uniform business settled it.</p>

<p>"We'll come, if the rest of the Gang will," they
told him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good! Shake hands on it."</p>

<p>"Attention, Scouts!" shouted Mr. Norton, after
he had shaken hands.</p>

<p>"Salute enemy!"</p>

<p>We gave the Scout salute to the Gingham Ground
boys, while they stood there grinning and not knowing
what to do.</p>

<p>Then, after whispering together, they gave us the
Gang yell. It was great.</p>

<p>"We'll be there," they called, as they started
up the street.</p>

<p>They were, too, ten of them, with Jim Donavan
at their head. They came across lots from the
Quaker Meeting House, soon after we had gathered
around the big stone where we have our fires,
just as they had come two years before, the
time we had our big fight and came to know
Jim.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton saw them coming and went to meet
them.</p>

<p>"This is fine," said he, after we all had sat
down on the grass around the fire. "You are
a pretty husky bunch of fellows, and Raven Patrol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
will have to go some to keep up, after you get
started. Skinny&mdash;I mean Gabriel&mdash;suppose you
tell our visitors something about the Scouts."</p>

<p>"It's great," began Skinny. "We've been bandits
and we've been Injuns, but Scouts beat 'em all.
The woods are full of 'em all over the country,
and they go about with uniforms on, doing good
and having fun. They are like an army. We are
one company, you will be another. I'm the same
as captain, only they call me patrol leader. Mr.
Norton is Scoutmaster, and there are officers above
him, only we never saw them. We learn all about
woodcraft and signs and signaling and how to do
a lot of things, and we rescue people and do all
kinds of stunts and get badges. The Ravens are
going across the mountain on an exploring trip.
I am going to look for a cave and maybe there is
treasure in it. Our patrol animal is the crow, and
it 'most ought to be yours because you live so near
the Raven Rocks."</p>

<p>Skinny had run down by this time, although Bill
was winding him up like a clock behind his back
and making a clicking noise with his tongue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"G'wan!" said he, turning around and catching
him at it, "or I'll biff you one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better add a little to that explanation,"
said Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>Then he told all about it, much as he had told
us that first time, and about Scout law; what it
meant to be a Scout; how it made boys manly, and
how much fun they would have.</p>

<p>"What I want is a troop," said he, when he had
finished the story. "Several patrols together are
called a troop. I would be in charge as Scoutmaster.
Raven Patrol is now in pretty good shape.
We are going on a camping expedition in a few
weeks and we'll have a good chance to practise up
on signaling, swimming, following trails through
the woods, and things like that. Next year I
should like to take a whole troop along.
What do you say? Suppose you go over by
that other stone and talk about it among yourselves."</p>

<p>"I know what I'll say, right now," said Jim,
"but perhaps we'd better talk it over just the
same."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>We saw them whispering together for about five
minutes. Then they came back.</p>

<p>"We'll do it," said Jim. "And we'll do the
best we can, only we may make mistakes at first.
We are going to take the American eagle for our
patrol animal on account of this being the Fourth
of July."</p>

<p>"Everybody makes mistakes," Mr. Norton told
him, "but the boy or the man who has the right
stuff in him never makes the same mistake twice.
Suppose that you elect a patrol leader to-night before
we separate, because we shall want to consult
together a great deal in the next few days and I
shall be too busy to see you all."</p>

<p>"Jim," they began to yell, all keeping time.
"Jim! Jim! Jim!"</p>

<p>"Jim, you seem to be elected," said Mr. Norton,
reaching out and shaking hands with him.</p>

<p>"Speech!" yelled Hank.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said Benny, getting up
on his feet and bowing right and left, "the Honorable
James Donavan will now say a few words,
if he dast."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim looked as if he wanted to run, but in a minute
he braced up.</p>

<p>"I never made a speech in my life," said he,
"and I ain't going to make one now, but you will
find the Gang true blue. We ain't much on clothes,
and our folks haven't got much money, but we'll
do the best we can, if you will tell us how. And we
are much obliged for taking us in."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Captain Donavan and Eagle
Patrol," shouted Mr. Norton, waving his hat.
"Now!"</p>

<p>I'll bet they heard us down in the village. After
it was quiet again I saw Skinny whispering something
to Bill. Bill nodded his head and passed it
on to Hank, and finally it came to Benny and me,
who sat at the end of the line. We nodded and
began to creep nearer the fire while waiting for
the signal.</p>

<p>"Caw!" yelled Skinny, all of a sudden, like
you sometimes hear a big crow in the Bellows Pipe.</p>

<p>As he yelled, he grabbed a burning brand out
of the fire, and the rest of us did the same. Then
we formed a circle and danced a war dance around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the Gang, whirling our brands in the air until the
sparks flew in the growing darkness and there
seemed to be a ring of fire.</p>

<p>"Shall we eat 'em alive, my braves?" chanted
Skinny.</p>

<p>"No," we shouted. "They are brothers."</p>

<p>"Shall we mop the earth with 'em?"</p>

<p>"No," we yelled. "They are Scouts."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Skinny, stopping
in front of Jim, who was too surprised to say
anything.</p>

<p>"Give them the glad hand," we answered.</p>

<p>"'Tis well," said he, grabbing Jim by the hand,
while we did the same to the others.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Mr. Norton, a little
later. "I feel so good over this that I'll buy.
Lead me to a soda fountain."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANNING A CAMPING TRIP<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WE boys often think of what a fisherman
told us one summer day, out on Illinois
River, at the foot of Buffalo Rock.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i002.png" width="330" height="500" alt="&quot;IT GIVES ME PAIN,&quot; SHE SAID, &quot;TO INFORM YOU THAT THE WOODBOX IS EMPTY.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT GIVES ME PAIN,&quot; SHE SAID, &quot;TO INFORM YOU THAT THE WOODBOX IS EMPTY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Play," said he, "is work that you want to do
and don't have to do," or something like that.</p>

<p>Ma often says, when she sees us playing, that
if she should make me work that hard I would
think I was abused.</p>

<p>I guess, maybe, that is so. It surely is some
work to chase uphill and around, play ball, and
do all kinds of stunts, and sometimes when night
comes we feel tired.</p>

<p>I went home to supper one day, all fagged out,
so tired I hardly could drag one foot after the
other, and flopped down in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>Ma heard me and put her head in at the door.</p>

<p>"It gives me pain," she said, "to inform you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that the woodbox is empty and I need a hotter fire
to bake those biscuits that you like so well."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ma!" I exclaimed. "Can't you get along
until morning. I'm all in."</p>

<p>"Why, you haven't done a thing to-day!" she
told me.</p>

<p>I had climbed up and down Bob's Hill six times;
been up to Peck's Falls and the cave once; followed
the brook over rocks and fallen trees to where it
tumbles out of a sunshiny pasture into the shade
of the woods in a great watery sheet; been swimming
in the Basin, on the other side of the valley;
played a match game of baseball at the Eagle
ground; played Indian in Plunkett's woods, tracking
the enemy through the forest; played foot-and-a-half,
until I thought my back would break, and
wrestled with Skinny, until he fell on me like a
thousand of brick. But I hadn't done anything all
day! Oh, no!</p>

<p>"You don't want me to do it, do you?" she said.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't want that; so, tired as I was,
I dragged out to the shed and brought in an armful
of wood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then I heard a whistle, followed by the
caw of a crow from in front of the house, and
I chased out to see what was doing.</p>

<p>It was Benny. He had come over to tell me that
there would be a Scout meeting at his house that
night.</p>

<p>"John's too tired," Ma told him. "He hardly
was able to bring in four sticks of wood."</p>

<p>"I feel better now," I hurried to say. "The
exercise did me good. After I have had some of
your delicious biscuits and some honey, I'll be all
right again. Besides, I'd hate to miss a Scout
meeting; I learn so much there. Will the wood
I brought in last until morning?"</p>

<p>"I thought Mr. Norton was away?" she
said.</p>

<p>"He is; but they are going to have a meeting,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, please let him go, Mrs. Smith," put in
Benny. "Pedro is our secretary. We can't have
the meeting without him."</p>

<p>Ma likes Benny so well I just knew she would
have to give in. She knew it, too, I guess, for she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
looked at us a minute, sort of smiling to herself;
then she said:</p>

<p>"Well, if he will come home at nine o'clock and
promise to take a nap to-morrow afternoon, I'll
let him go. He has been losing too much sleep
lately."</p>

<p>I didn't think much of that nap business. Daytime
wasn't made to sleep in, except, maybe,
the early morning hours when you first wake
up.</p>

<p>"I'll promise to lie down and shut my eyes," I
told her, "but I can't promise to take a nap, can
I? The sleep may not come."</p>

<p>That is true. I've laid awake a lot of times fifteen
or twenty minutes and maybe more, at night,
trying hard to go to sleep and not feeling a bit
sleepy.</p>

<p>That is why I was in bed when Skinny came
around the next afternoon. He knew that I would
be, and instead of coming into the back yard and
up on the stoop, as he usually does, he went up the
drive between our house and Phillips' and whistled
softly under my window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>With one bound I was out of bed and looking
down at him. He had on his Scout uniform, and
his rope was wound around his shoulders.</p>

<p>I was just going to tell him to wait until I
could come downstairs, when he put one finger to
his lips, then looked up and down the drive to see
who was watching. There was nobody in sight.
Ma was taking a nap in her room and I guess Mrs.
Phillips was, too, across the way.</p>

<p>"S-s-t!" he hissed. "Are you alone?"</p>

<p>I nodded. It didn't seem safe to say anything.</p>

<p>"You ain't chained to the bed, or nothin', are
you?"</p>

<p>"Nary a chain," I told him. "We are all out
of chains."</p>

<p>"'Tis well!" said he, coiling up the rope in one
hand and getting ready to throw. "Quick, now,
and mum's the word!"</p>

<p>I caught the rope as it came in through the
window and fastened one end to the bed. Then
I threw out the other end, climbed out myself, and
shinned down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked, as soon as I had
reached the ground.</p>

<p>"Let's go around and untie the rope; then I'll
tell you."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was showing me a letter
which he had from Mr. Norton, who was away on
business. This is what the letter said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Fellows</span>:&mdash;I shall be at home in a few
days and should like to have a meeting of Raven
Patrol to talk up our camping trip. Are you
thinking about it and planning where to go? The
pasture above Peck's Falls would make an ideal
camp. There is water and sunshine and shade and
old Greylock. That would suit me pretty well, but
it is so near home it might not suit you. If not,
I have a regular trip over the mountain in mind,
one that will take a hike of several days to get us
there. Talk it over among yourselves and ask your
folks about it. Then meet at my house next Saturday
night. We'll decide the matter and begin
to get ready. Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"Ain't he a brick?" said Skinny, when he had
finished reading. "What do you say, old Scout?"</p>

<p>"I say hike," I told him. "That pasture above
Peck's Falls is where Tom Chapin tried to paralyze
a bull by the power of the human eye, like the
school reader says, and got thrown over the stone
wall by the critter. No more of that for muh!"</p>

<p>"We'd have a rope along, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, and who'd tie it and what would the bull
be doing all that time?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather go over the mountain on a hike, myself,"
he said. "Come on, let's ask the other
boys."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute while I fill the woodbox," I told
him.</p>

<p>Skinny helped me do that and we were soon on
our way.</p>

<p>The other boys felt just as we did about it. Of
course, it is always fun to be near our cave and
it is a fine place to get into when it rains, but we
could go there any old time.</p>

<p>The folks seemed to think near home would be
better, until we told them about the bull and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
near we all came to getting killed. They had forgotten
about that and so had we, almost.</p>

<p>Finally Pa settled it for me.</p>

<p>"I am willing to leave it to Mr. Norton," he
said. "As long as he goes with you I don't care
much where you go, for I know that he will take
as good care of you as I could myself. His hold
on you boys is remarkable and I am willing to back
him in anything that he wants to do. I'll say this
much, however. He is going to have his hands full
when he undertakes to look after you boys for a
week or two at a time."</p>

<p>We hardly could wait until Saturday night to
hear Mr. Norton's plan and decide what to do.</p>

<p>He seemed glad to see us when the time came,
only he wouldn't hurry the meeting or leave anything
out. Skinny, being patrol leader, always
acted as chairman and pounded the table, when
he could find one to pound.</p>

<p>"The meetin' will come to order," said he, looking
around for something to thump and not finding
anything but Bill Wilson, who dodged out of
the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"The secretary will call the roll."</p>

<p>I called the names of the boys, and each one in
turn arose and gave the Scout salute, first to Mr.
Norton, then to Skinny.</p>

<p>"Is there any business to come before this 'ere
meetin'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," I said, jumping up.</p>

<p>"The gentleman from Park Street," said Skinny,
as big as life, just as Pa had taught us to do at
meetings in our barn.</p>

<p>"We have with us this evening our Scoutmaster,
who, I think, has something to say."</p>

<p>"'Tis well," said Skinny. "We'll harken unto
his words of wisdom."</p>

<p>"Before I speak the words of wisdom which
our patrol leader has so kindly mentioned," laughed
Mr. Norton, "I will ask Mrs. Norton to refresh
and fortify us with some lemonade."</p>

<p>Benny reached the door almost as soon as she did.</p>

<p>"Let me do it, Mrs. Norton," he said.</p>

<p>He grabbed the pitcher and tray and poured out
a glass for her; then went around the circle. It
tasted fine on a warm night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman," said Mr. Norton, after we had
emptied the pitcher. "I want to call up the question
of our camping trip. Have you boys thought
about the matter?"</p>

<p>"We haven't thought of much else," Hank told
him.</p>

<p>"Well, how about it? Shall we camp out above
Peck's Falls? What do you say, William?"</p>

<p>"It's too near home," said Bill. "Ma would
get scared the first night and call me back."</p>

<p>"That certainly would be serious. What do
you say, Mr. Secretary?"</p>

<p>"I say so, too," I told him. "It's fine up there
and wild and all that, but let's go where we never
have been before."</p>

<p>"How about it, Mr. President?"</p>

<p>"It's me for the hike," said Skinny.</p>

<p>The other boys all said the same.</p>

<p>"It seems to be unanimous," said Mr. Norton.
"I thought that probably you would feel that way.
Well, this is what I have in mind, in case you decide
to take the trip, instead of remaining near
home. What do you say to hiking straight east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
over Florida Mountain, as far as Deerfield and the
Connecticut River? We can get a horse and carry
our camping outfit and supplies in a wagon. We
can take turns driving. It will rest us, and if anybody
should give out the wagon will come in handy.
We can take as long a time as we want on the
way, camping out each night."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton stopped and looked at us to see how
we liked the plan. Say, it didn't take him long
to find out. Every boy jumped to his feet and
shouted. Skinny forgot that he was chairman and
started to march around the room, shooting and
striking at the enemy, and we all fell in line after
him except Bill. He stood on his hands, kicked
his feet in the air, and whistled through his
teeth.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman," he said, as soon as we had
taken our places again. "I hardly think it necessary
to put that to a vote except, perhaps, as a
matter of form. The next question is, will your
folks let you go? Sometimes fathers and mothers
have very decided notions about what they want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
their boys to do and more especially what they
don't want them to do."</p>

<p>I told him what Pa had said about being willing
to have us go anywhere with him, and the
other boys said that their folks felt the same
way.</p>

<p>"Good! We'll consider that settled and get
down to details as quickly as possible. I should
like to get started in about two weeks, which will
be early in August. We'll call another meeting
in a few days and I'll have a list of the articles
needed and their cost ready to submit to you. I
know where we can get tents, but there are a whole
lot of things we shall need in the woods, besides
things to eat. Is there any more business to come
before the meeting, Mr. Chairman?"</p>

<p>"There is," said Skinny, who had been scribbling
something on a piece of paper. He handed it to me
to read, and this is what it said:</p>

<p>"Resolved, that Mr. Norton is great stuff."</p>

<p>"All that are in favor of the motion salute the
Scoutmaster."</p>

<p>That ended the meeting. We had to have several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
more like it before we could get everything
ready for the trip.</p>

<p>"It is early yet," said Mr. Norton. "If you
would like to have me, I'll tell you a story about
what I think was one of the greatest scouting trips
ever undertaken."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCOUTING IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"SOME of you boys went out to Illinois, last
summer," he began. "Did you go as far
as the Mississippi River?"</div>

<p>"No, but we camped out on the Illinois River,"
I told him, "and that flows into the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"We explored," explained Benny, "just like
LaSalle and Tonty and the other guys did. Skinny
was LaSalle and I was Tonty."</p>

<p>"LaSalle and Tonty were great scouts. Do you
remember when they made those early explorations?"</p>

<p>"I think it was somewhere around 1680 or
1681," said Skinny, who was always good in history.
"Mr. Baxter told us all about it while we
were sitting on top of Starved Rock, where LaSalle
once had a fort."</p>

<p>"There was a great country west of the Mississippi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
about which LaSalle knew very little, although
when he explored the river he took possession
of the land in the name of his king, and he
called the country Louisiana.</p>

<p>"At that time, with the exception of a few fur
traders and missionaries, all the people who came
to America from the Old World settled along the
Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, in various colonies.
Some of these afterward became the thirteen
original states of the United States of America.</p>

<p>"After Thomas Jefferson became president, he
had a chance to buy Louisiana of Napoleon, who
was then at the head of the French government,
and he did so."</p>

<p>"Huh! Napoleon!" said Skinny. "George
Washington could lick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, ferget it, can't you?" said Bill. "You
are stopping the story."</p>

<p>"That gave us a vast territory, reaching from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Rocky Mountains. Nobody
knew very much about it, or about the country
west of the Rockies. Jefferson may have been
looking far into the future when he made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Louisiana purchase, but probably his more immediate
purpose was to secure undisputed possession
of the wonderful Mississippi River.</p>

<p>"That was in 1804, only a little more than a
lifetime ago and nearly a century and a half after
LaSalle explored the river and took possession of
the country. Little, if anything, was known about
the country at the time of its purchase by the United
States more than was known in LaSalle's time. A
few hardy traders went up and down the river,
buying furs of friendly Indians, and that was
all.</p>

<p>"Naturally, after Jefferson had bought it, he
wanted to know something about his purchase. So
he appointed two men to explore the new country.
I want you to remember their names, because they
did a great work. One was Meriwether Lewis and
the other William Clark, and you will find their
trip described in your school history as 'the Lewis
and Clark expedition.' I can't see why their exploration
was not attended by as much danger and
hardship as LaSalle's, which had been undertaken
so many years before. The dense forests and great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rivers of the West were all unknown and there were
many hostile Indians.</p>

<p>"What did you boys do, when you made up your
minds to explore the rivers in Illinois last summer?"</p>

<p>"We built a boat," Hank told him.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And that was what Lewis and Clark
did, or, rather, it was done for them at Government
expense. A keel boat, fifty-five feet long and drawing
not more than three feet of water, was made
for them at Pittsburgh, where, if you remember,
two rivers unite to form the Ohio. This boat had
places for twenty-two oarsmen and carried a large,
square sail. Steamboats were not known in those
days, although a few years afterward Robert Fulton
ran one on Hudson River. The Government
also provided two smaller boats and loaded them
with coffee, sugar, crackers, dried meats, carpenter's
tools, presents for the Indians, and things like
that. A few horses also were taken along in the
large boat.</p>

<p>"The leaders selected a crew of twenty-five men,
and one fine day the whole outfit started down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Ohio River. When they reached the Mississippi
they turned north and soon made their way up
the great river to St. Louis. St. Louis was a
French trading station then. Now it is a large
city. A few years ago the hundredth anniversary
of the Louisiana purchase was celebrated by holding
a world's fair in St. Louis.</p>

<p>"There more men joined the expedition and
considerable information that President Jefferson
wanted was picked up about the Indian tribes who
lived up and down the river.</p>

<p>"Finally, May 14, 1804, the explorers started on
the real trip. It wasn't easy work any longer, for
they had to row against the mighty current of the
Mississippi. After they had gone a few miles they
came to another great river, which was pouring a
dirty looking, yellow flood into the Mississippi.
Who can tell me what that river was?"</p>

<p>"The Missouri," said Benny, who had been
studying about it in school. "The Mississippi
River, with its principal tributary, the Missouri, is
the longest river in the world."</p>

<p>"Right you are. If you will look on some map<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
you will see how it is possible to go in a boat from
Pittsburgh almost across the continent. Lewis and
Clark turned into the Missouri and started for the
then unknown Northwest. They made their way
along very slowly, for the river was swollen with
heavy rains and the current was very strong.</p>

<p>"After much labor and hardship they managed
to reach the mouth of the Osage River. There
they went into camp and sent out an armed party
to explore the interior. When the party returned
they brought back ten deer and all had a great
feast on the river bank.</p>

<p>"Once more they breasted the fierce current,
narrowly escaping shipwreck several times. Once
the wind was so strong that they were obliged to
anchor and go ashore. Again they had to pull
their boats along with ropes through some rapids."</p>

<p>"Betcher life they didn't go without a rope,"
said Skinny. "Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Somebody threw a sofa pillow just then and it
struck exactly where his face happened to be. Before
he could find out who did it Mr. Norton went
on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last they reached the mouth of the Kansas
River. A large city stands there now. Does
anybody know the name of it?"</p>

<p>"That is too far from home," said Benny. "I
know what city is at the mouth of Hoosac River.
There ain't any."</p>

<p>"Kansas City now stands where they went
into camp. They divided into two parties.
One went out after game, so that there should
be plenty to eat, and the other explored the
country."</p>

<p>"It's fun to explore," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Probably these men found a certain pleasure
in it, notwithstanding the hardships. They were
seeing something new every day. After a time
they started once more and late in July reached
the mouth of the Platte River. They had heard
that a tribe of Indians were living near there, so
Lewis and Clark went out with a party to find
them and tell them that the country now belonged
to the Great Father at Washington. Under some
bluffs, opposite the present city of Omaha, they
sat in council with the Indians, made them gifts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and smoked the peace pipe. The Indians didn't
seem to care who owned the country so long as
they received presents and had room enough to
hunt. A city now stands on those bluffs where the
Indian council was held. I guess you can tell me
the name of that one."</p>

<p>"Council Bluffs," said two or three of us at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Then on went the explorers up the river,
through a wonderful country. Vast prairies, covered
with grass and without any trees, stretched
away in every direction, as far as they could see,
and great herds of buffalo roamed up and down.
On they went, through what is now Nebraska; then
through South Dakota; then, North Dakota, where
some fierce Indians dwelt. Another council was
held and more presents were given. When the boat
was about to put off after this council, the Indians
grabbed hold of the cable and held it. They
wouldn't let go."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill. "I'll bet they didn't
do a thing to those Injuns. I'll bet they paralyzed
them. They had guns, didn't they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and they did sort of paralyze the savages,
I guess.</p>

<p>"'Take aim but don't fire,' Lewis told his men.</p>

<p>"The next second those Indians were looking
into the muzzles of about twenty-five guns."</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" shouted Skinny, swinging
his arms and then pretending to shoot. "Did they
kill them all?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you boys are a little bloodthirsty,"
said Mr. Norton. "They didn't shoot at
all. When the Indians saw the pointed guns they
dropped the cable and pretended that all they
wanted was to do some more trading. The white
men were glad enough to let it go at that and get
away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"It soon became necessary to go into camp for
the winter. An island in the river was chosen
for the purpose and they spent the winter there.
The Indians in the vicinity proved to be friendly.
They never had seen white men before, possibly
that was the reason. Some of the things which
are very common to us seemed wonderful to them.
Do you remember how I lighted the fire one day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
when we wanted to cook dinner on Bob's Hill and
had forgotten the matches?"</p>

<p>"With a sunglass," I told him.</p>

<p>"Well, that didn't seem very astonishing to us
because we were used to it, but the Indians had
never seen a sunglass. They started their fires by
rubbing two sticks together. Even the whites had
to use a flint and steel, for the art of making matches
hadn't been discovered. Captain Clark carried a
sunglass in his pocket. One day he went to an
Indian village, intending to smoke a peace pipe
with the chief. As he was entering the village, he
saw some wild geese flying over and shot one. The
Indians heard what seemed to be thunder and saw
the goose fall, and it scared them. They ran into
their wigwams and closed the skin doors. Soon
after Captain Clark came up to the wigwam of the
chief, without thinking he was doing anything out
of the ordinary, he pulled out his sunglass and
lighted his pipe with it.</p>

<p>"The frightened Indians were peeking out of
their wigwams, and when they saw the white man
start a blaze in his pipe by holding up one hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
they felt sure that he was a spirit. The Redskins
gave one yell and ran into the woods. It was a
long time before they could be made to understand.</p>

<p>"Spring came at last and the impatient party
started up the river again. The way grew more
and more difficult. They were now a long distance
from the mouth of the river, and the water was
shallow in places and filled with dangerous rocks.
Often they had to get out and wade, pulling the
boats along by the cables.</p>

<p>"May 26 they passed the mouth of the Yellowstone
River and for the first time saw the Rocky
Mountains in the distance, covered with snow and
looking very grand. They were then in Montana,
or what we now call Montana.</p>

<p>"In June they heard the roaring of a cataract,
and Lewis started out afoot to find it. After he
had traveled for hours he climbed a cliff and at
last looked down upon the cataract. So far as we
know he was the first white man who had ever
seen it, although thousands see it every year now.
The cascades of the Missouri stretch for thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
miles, with foaming rapids between. It is a great
sight."</p>

<p>"Gee, Peck's Falls ain't in it," said Skinny.
"Did he find a cave?"</p>

<p>"History fails to mention a cave. Lewis went
back and ordered the boats to proceed up the river
as far as the first rapids. The question was, how
to get around those cascades. They couldn't go
up the river, so they had to get the boats around
in some way. Their horses had died during the
winter. There was nothing to do but drag the
boats around eighteen miles. The men went to
work and made rough carts, felled trees, cleared
away bushes, dug out rocks, leveled off the ground,
and pulled, pushed, and struggled on, until at last
the work was accomplished and the boats were
launched again in the river above the rapids.</p>

<p>"But soon the river became too shallow for the
large boat and they had to stop again. Then they
cut down trees and made 'dugouts.' They paddled
on until finally they came to a most wonderful
place. We think that the ravine below Peck's Falls
and that at the Basin are grand and beautiful, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
so they are, but they found a great canyon, whose
walls in places were a thousand feet high.</p>

<p>"Beyond this canyon they could not go in their
boats, for they were at the foot of the first range
of the Rockies. They had to leave their boats there
and climb. But, first, Lewis started out alone to
find some Indians for guides.</p>

<p>"The brave man made his way to the top of the
ridge and looked down into the valley beyond. In
that valley flowed a river, and far up the stream
he could see an Indian village. It was the home
of the Shoshones. He managed to reach the village,
and by offering presents induced some of the
Indians to go back with him, bringing horses, and
to guide his men across the mountains.</p>

<p>"The trip was a very perilous one, even with
guides, and it took them a whole month to cross.
Up, up they climbed, so high that they could not
find any game to shoot. One by one, the horses
died from exhaustion, and the starving men ate the
flesh to keep themselves alive.</p>

<p>"After terrible hardships, they finally left the
mountains behind and came upon streams which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
flowed toward the west. Here they rested, secured
a new supply of food, built new boats, and then,
when all was ready, paddled down the Lewis and
Clark rivers into the broad Columbia, which, as
you know, pours its waters into the Pacific Ocean.
They had crossed the entire country from Pittsburgh
to the Pacific, and made the whole trip by
water except that terrible journey across the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>"It was now November and they were forced
to go into camp once more to spend the winter
months. In the spring they started on the long
journey home again and at last reached Washington,
where they told the President about the vast
Northwest and what a great country he had purchased
from France."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what let's do," said Benny, after
Mr. Norton had finished. "When we start on our
trip let's play we are Lewis and Clark 'sploring the
country."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CLOUDBURST ON GREYLOCK<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SKINNY says that if they would let him run
the weather he wouldn't have it rain daytimes
during vacation. All of us Boy Scouts feel that
way, too, because, what's the use? The days are
made for boys to have fun in and the nights are
made to sleep. So, why not have it rain nights
when folks are sleeping?</div>

<p>Anyhow, it rained that August as we never had
seen it rain before and never want to see it again.
It began in the night, all right, just like rain ought
to do, but it didn't stop. When day came it seemed
to take a fresh start and kept going. It rained all
day long and we couldn't have any fun at all.
When it came time to go to bed it quit for a spell,
but it started up again before morning. It wasn't
any drizzle, either. It came down in bucketfuls,
until I thought the village would be washed away
and that even Bob's Hill would float off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Along about ten o'clock in the morning it let up,
and pretty soon, who should come along but Skinny
and Bill, barefooted and with old clothes on. They
were worried about the cave, and so was I. While
it was raining so hard I thought about it a lot.</p>

<p>You see, our cave is a little below Peck's Falls,
on the bank of the brook. There are two entrances.
One goes in from the top on the upper
side. You first go down into a hole and then
wriggle through an opening, until you come out
into the real cave. We don't use that one except
when we want to escape from the enemy, or something
like that.</p>

<p>The one we use is below, right at the edge of
the water, and leads straight into the real cave.
The floor of the cave is even with the water at
the entrance and then slopes back a little out of
the wet.</p>

<p>Once a flood filled the cave and nearly drowned
us. We should have been drowned, if Tom Chapin
hadn't been with us. He dove down through the
hole into the upper cave and then pulled us through
after him. After that we built a dam so that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
would not happen again. I told all about that once
in the doings of the Band. What we were worrying
about was the dam's giving way.</p>

<p>Almost always in summer the brook is fine. It
pours a clear stream down over the rocks and kind
of talks to us and sings, so that we like to be in
the cave and listen to it. But sometimes in the
spring of the year, when the snow on the mountain
is melting and old winter is running away into the
valley, and sometimes after very hard rains, the
water roars over the falls and then dashes down
through the gulch and over the rocks below, like
some wild beast. At those times, it is a good place
to keep away from, unless you have a dam or a
cave that needs looking after.</p>

<p>"Get your hat, Pedro, and come on," said Skinny.
"We want to see about the dam. If it washes out
the water will fill our cave."</p>

<p>"And bring a shovel," added Bill. "We'd
brought one, only your house is so much nearer."</p>

<p>"All right," I told them. "Whistle for Benny,
while I'm getting it."</p>

<p>The four of us went up through the orchard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and took the road around the hill to the top because
the rain had made it too slippery to climb
straight up. We knew by the roaring of the water,
long before we came in sight, that Peck's Falls
were going it for all they were worth.</p>

<p>When we finally, one after another, crept out on
the ledge of Pulpit Rock, in front of the falls, the
sight almost scared us. It was great, the way the
water came down, fairly jumping from rock to
rock, until with a final leap and roar, it plunged, all
white and foaming, into an angry pool below; then
dashed off, with a snarl, through the ravine.</p>

<p>"Gee-whillikens!" said Skinny. "Those are
some falls, all right. How'd you like to go in
swimming?"</p>

<p>"It would just about use a fellow up to go
through there," I told him. "Boost me up so that
I can look down at the cave."</p>

<p>"We'll boost Benny," he said. "He isn't so
heavy."</p>

<p>The pulpit part reaches up several feet above
the narrow ledge like a wall, and back of it there
is a straight drop, a hundred feet or more down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cave is all right, I guess," Benny told us,
when we had held him up so that he could see over
without getting dizzy. "I can see where the upper
entrance is, but, say, the brook is fierce."</p>

<p>We crept off from the rock and made our way
carefully down the side of the ravine to the cave.</p>

<p>It was as Benny had said. The dam had held
and was keeping the water from flooding the cave.
The upper entrance was all right, although it was
too muddy to use. The water had backed up
around the lower entrance and part way into the
cave, but beyond it was dry.</p>

<p>The little mountain brook had turned into a torrent,
raging along like some wild beast, and foaming
over the rocks below, almost like Peck's Falls.
Just above these smaller falls, a tree, which had
been carried down into the ravine, stretched across
the stream from rock to rock, with its slippery trunk
about two feet above the water.</p>

<p>"I guess everything is all right," said Skinny,
"but maybe we'd better fix the dam a little. Gee,
but it's getting dark in here."</p>

<p>We worked a few minutes, throwing rocks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
dirt against the dam. I had just stood off to say
that I thought it would hold now, when Skinny
gave an awful yell and slipped off from a rock, on
which he had been standing, into the flood.</p>

<p>I made a grab for him and missed, and in a second
he was whirled down the stream.</p>

<p>It is queer how much thinking one can do in a
second. I thought of the rocks and of the falls
below and of how nobody could go through without
being pounded against the stones.</p>

<p>I was afraid to look, until I heard another yell.
Then we yelled, too, for there was Skinny clinging
to the tree which stretched across the stream, just
above the lower falls, and yelling to beat the band.</p>

<p>The water pulled and tore at his legs, dragging
them under the tree and to the very edge of the
rock which formed the falls. On his face was
such a look, when we came near, that I knew he
could not hang on much longer.</p>

<p>"Hold on tight, Skinny," I called. "We are
coming."</p>

<p>It did not take us long to get there, but when
we came opposite to where he was hanging we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
could not reach him, and the log was too slippery
to walk on.</p>

<p>"Can't you work yourself along the tree?" I
asked. "We can't reach, and even if we could
walk out I don't see how we'd ever get back."</p>

<p>He shook his head in despair.</p>

<p>"I can hardly hold on at all," he told us. "I'll
have to let go in a minute, if you don't do something.
Get the rope. You always want a rope."</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of the rope which we have
kept in the cave since the time I told about, when
the flood came near drowning us.</p>

<p>Then Bill, being corporal, pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"Run to the cave for the rope," said he, "while
I hold him."</p>

<p>Before we could say a word or stop him, he
straddled the tree and began to work his way out,
hitching himself along with his hands.</p>

<p>"Run," he yelled again, when he saw us looking
with pale faces. "Skinny saved me and I'll save
him, if it takes a leg."</p>

<p>We were halfway to the cave before he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
finished speaking. I helped Benny in through the
water, holding him to make sure that he wouldn't
slip, and in two or three seconds he was out again
with the rope.</p>

<p>We found Bill clinging to the slippery tree with
both legs and holding Skinny by the collar with
both hands. Skinny had a fresh grip and was
hanging on for all he was worth.</p>

<p>We tied a slip noose in one end of the rope and
threw it to Bill.</p>

<p>"You'll have to let go with one hand at a time,
Skinny," I heard him say. "Wait until I get a
better grip. Now!"</p>

<p>I saw Skinny let go for a second with his left
hand. Bill hung to his collar with one hand and
with the other put the loop over his head and
under his arm. Then Skinny grabbed hold again
and did the same with the other hand.</p>

<p>"Pull her tight, boys. Easy now."</p>

<p>We pulled until the noose tightened under
Skinny's shoulders. Then we waded into the water
as far as we dared and pulled steadily on the rope.
Skinny scrambled along through the water, digging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
his finger nails into the bark, with Bill holding on
to his collar as long as he could reach.</p>

<p>By the time we had him out it had grown so
dark that we hardly could see Bill, but we knew
he was out there because we heard him say "great
snakes."</p>

<p>"Throw me the rope," he called.</p>

<p>He put the noose around his own shoulders, and
with our help was soon standing on the ground.</p>

<p>"I swam her all right," said Skinny, "but I
hadn't ought to have done it. Ma told me not to
go swimming to-day."</p>

<p>Just as he said that something seemed to shut us
in. The light was blotted out and we stood there
in the dark, scared and wet, wondering what was
going to happen.</p>

<p>We groped our way along until we reached the
cave and crawled in through the water. I didn't
like to do it because I knew that if the dam should
give way the cave would be flooded. But we had
made it stronger and we had the rope to climb
out by at the upper hole, if the worst should come.</p>

<p>The water didn't reach far into the cave, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
soon we had a light, for we always keep candles
and matches there.</p>

<p>It didn't seem so scary when we could see, sitting
down together on a piece of old carpet which
the folks had given us, where we had sat many
times before.</p>

<p>What happened next, they say, was a cloudburst.
Something burst, anyhow. Skinny had just
grinned and said that he thought maybe it was
going to rain, when it started.</p>

<p>And rain! Say, we never had seen it rain before.
It came down in chunks and pailfuls.
Pretty soon the water began to creep farther into
the cave, and we got out the rope and made ready
to crawl through into the other part, if it should
come much farther.</p>

<p>But the dam held, and there we were, snug and
safe, with our candle throwing dancing shadows,
and up against one side of the cave, where we had
hung it long before, our motto:</p>

<p>"Resolved, that the Boys of Bob's Hill are going
to make good."</p>

<p>Then we heard a distant roar, different from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
anything we ever had heard before and different
from any other noise the storm was making. It
scared us because we couldn't think what it was.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Skinny. "What's broke loose,
now?"</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" I heard Bill say. "I wish I
hadn't come."</p>

<p>Benny didn't say anything, but he grabbed my
hand and by the way he hung on I knew he was
doing a lot of thinking.</p>

<p>That roar seemed to be the end of the storm,
for the rain stopped as quickly as it had come. It
began to grow light again and somewhere in the
woods we heard a bird singing.</p>

<p>We were glad enough to get out into daylight
once more and make our way back to the road.</p>

<p>"Let's see what it was that roared so," I said.
"It isn't going to rain any more and Skinny is
nearly dry."</p>

<p>We could see great patches of blue sky and
knew that the storm was over.</p>

<p>The roaring had seemed to come from the mountain,
so we climbed up the road and went into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
field beyond the woods, from which we usually can
see old Greylock looming up, only looking different,
it is so near.</p>

<p>This time we couldn't see him at all. The sky
was clear overhead, but clouds still hung about the
mountain, shutting him from sight.</p>

<p>Then, as we stood there, the noise came again,
only worse this time, and right in front of us.
The ground seemed to tremble under our feet and
from somewhere, back of the cloud which covered
the mountainside, came a mighty roaring and grinding
that was awful.</p>

<p>We stood there, clinging to each other and wondering
if the end of the world had come, when
suddenly the cloud lifted and Skinny yelled:</p>

<p>"Look! Look!"</p>

<p>Down the face of Greylock, where before trees
had been growing, water was pouring over a great,
white scar, which reached from top to bottom,
nearly to where we stood, and over to the south
was a smaller scar.</p>

<p>"Guess what," said Benny. "Greylock is crying.
What do you know about that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been two landslides, the only ones
we ever had known to happen on the mountain.</p>

<p>And to this day, as far as you can see Greylock,
you will see those white scars of bare rock, stretching
down his face, as if some monstrous giant had
clawed him, but, of course, no water after that
first time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE WAY AT LAST<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>FOLKS in our town think that white streaks
down the face of Greylock do not improve
his looks any, but to us boys they seem like scars
won in battle. We feel like cheering some mornings,
when we see him fighting to break away from
storm clouds which wrap him around.</div>

<p>At first we can see nothing but clouds from
where we stand on Bob's Hill. Then, the clouds
begin to lift a little and Peck's Falls woods gradually
come into view. A little later the very tiptop
of the mountain begins to show, floating like an
island in an ocean of mist. While we look, the
clouds fall away still more, making the island
larger and larger, and the bottom mists roll up
the wooded sides of the hill.</p>

<p>In a few minutes old Greylock throws them off
altogether and stands there, with his scars showing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
except that across his face a narrow cloud
sometimes hangs like a billowy screen, giving him,
Ma says, a look of majesty as if God was living
there.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we boys can't help cheering when the
mountain shakes off his bonds and stands forth
like a giant Scout, telling us to be cheerful and
brave and reverent and all that.</p>

<p>The great rains did more than scar the face of
Greylock. They kept us from starting on our trip
at the time we had planned to go.</p>

<p>"Wait until the woods dry out," Mr. Norton
told us. "The roads are too muddy now to think
of starting, and you couldn't have any fun if the
woods were wet. A week of sunshine will fix
things all right."</p>

<p>We hated to wait, but there was plenty to do
getting ready, so that the time did not seem long.</p>

<p>"We'll carry no firearms," he went on. "Guns
seemed necessary when this was a wilderness, but
we are going over a fairly well traveled road.
Scouts do not believe in wanton killing, anyway."</p>

<p>"How about bears?" asked Skinny, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have made careful inquiries and have not
found anybody who has seen a bear along that road
in years. I know you found one near the Savoy
road, or he found you, but that cub was as badly
frightened as you were. Should any of us see a
bear, which is not at all likely, I don't believe there
is anything in Scout law to keep us from running
one way while the bear is running another."</p>

<p>"I don't know about a Scout's running," Skinny
told him. "Of course I ran, but I didn't run far,
only to the nearest tree, so that I could lasso him
better."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. Run to the nearest tree
and then give the Scout signal. Some of the noises
which you boys make, especially William, would
scare a whole drove of bears."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm going to carry my rope."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we can do. We'll put in
the week making bows and arrows. Every boy
should carry with him a good bow, made of hickory,
hemlock, or mountain ash, and a quiver full of
arrows. You never will have a better chance to
become experts in archery."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>We thought that we would make them of hemlock,
because there are plenty of hemlock trees up
above Peck's Falls and in Plunkett's woods, but
Mr. Norton told us that we ought to make them
of seasoned wood. The next day he sent some
seasoned hickory over to our barn and we made
the bows and arrows of that.</p>

<p>We took a lot of pains with them, and a carpenter
that Hank knew helped us some. Before
the week was over we had some weapons which
Skinny said he knew we could scare a bear with,
anyhow. Each Scout's bow was about as long as
himself and an inch thick in the center. The ends
were shaved down until they bent evenly. For
string, we used strong, unbleached linen threads,
twisted together. Benny made his bow so stiff at
first that he couldn't bend it, but Hank showed
him how to shave it down, until he could draw the
string back twenty-three inches, like the book says.</p>

<p>The arrows gave us the most trouble because
they had to be so straight and round. We made
them twenty-five inches long and about three-eighths
of an inch thick, and we glued turkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
feathers on near the notched end. The other end
we fitted into a brass ferrule, to keep the wood from
splitting. The arrows looked fine, when we had
them made and painted. Each boy painted his a
different way, so that we could tell which one killed
the bear.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton showed us how to make guards for
the left wrist, to keep the bow cord from striking
it. To protect the fingers of the right hand, we
used an old leather glove, with the thumb and
little finger cut away.</p>

<p>I'll never forget the morning we started. After
breakfast the boys, all in uniform, came over to
my house. Pretty soon Mr. Norton drove up in
a light wagon, loaded with tents, camp outfit, and
things to eat.</p>

<p>We greeted him with cheers, and when he had
come close gave him the Scout salute.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys. Let's get started, if you are
ready," he said. "We have a long walk ahead of
us, if we expect to camp on Florida Mountain to-night."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill. "That listens good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to little Willie!" And he gave a yell that brought
people out of their houses, all up and down Park
Street.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Pa, just as we were starting, "remember
that your folks are trusting you and, as we
understand it, a Scout's honor is to be trusted. Remember,
too, that it is a Scout's duty to obey
orders and that the one to give you orders while
you are away is Mr. Norton. And let me add that
he has my full sympathy. If he isn't worn to a
frazzle before he gets back, I'll miss my guess."</p>

<p>In another minute we were off, the folks calling
good-bys after us and shouting for us to remember
this and not to forget that and not to do something
else.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton drove the horse at the start because
he knew that we would want to march through
town, and away we went, with our bows and arrows
on our backs, and Skinny, with his rope and
hatchet, which he called his tomahawk.</p>

<p>At the Gingham Ground we found the boys of
Eagle Patrol drawn up by the side of the road.
They saluted and cheered as we passed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we have good luck this time, we'll take you
next year," called Mr. Norton. "I'm new at the
business, myself, and eight youngsters are all I
want to tackle the first time."</p>

<p>"Skinny! Oh, Skinny-y-y!" yelled Jim, when
we were almost out of hearing.</p>

<p>We stopped and waited to find out what was
wanted.</p>

<p>"Don't kill all the game-e-e. Save some for
seed."</p>

<p>Skinny's only answer was to wave his tomahawk.
Then we marched on toward North Adams,
and at nearly every house we passed people came
to the door to see what was going on. It made us
feel proud.</p>

<p>We took turns riding, two or three boys in
the wagon at a time, because Mr. Norton said that
he didn't want us to get all tired out before we
started and that we shouldn't be really started until
we came to the mountain.</p>

<p>The day was fine and the roads were getting
dusty again. We were so happy that almost before
we knew it we came to the foot of a hill, which led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
up into the mountain, and there we stopped to eat
lunch.</p>

<p>Before leaving home, I asked Pa why they called
it Florida Mountain and why they called a little
town on top Florida, and he said because that was
its name. Anyhow, they call 'em that. Before
Hoosac Tunnel was built under the mountain, a
stage coach made regular trips over it, along the
road we were going to take. That was the only
way people had to get to Greenfield and the other
towns on the east side, without going south to
Pittsfield and from there going over Mount Washington
on the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad. Now,
there is a big hole under the mountain, more than
four miles long, and trains go through in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>After we had eaten and had a good rest, we
started up a road, which we could see winding
up the mountainside, far above us.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Mr. Norton, "we don't have
to make this trip all in one day. We are out for
fun and to learn something about scouting; if we
climb too far in this hot sun it will get to be work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
instead of play. I propose that we climb slowly,
taking plenty of time to enjoy the wonderful views
that will unfold before us with every turn of the
road. You boys can stop whenever you feel like
it, to rest, or explore, or shoot. Before we get to
the top, we'll pitch our tents near some spring, in
full view of the valley and setting sun. We'll plan
it so as to have several hours of daylight left after
we go into camp for the night. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>That suited us all right and away we went,
with Benny driving, and the old horse moving along
in good shape.</p>

<p>Say, no tunnels for us, after this! Tunnels are
all right when you are in a hurry. But were we
in a hurry? I guess not!</p>

<p>It was just as Mr. Norton had told us. At every
turn of the road, and mountain roads wind around
with a lot of turns instead of going straight up,
we stopped to look back over the valley. And
every time we stopped it looked different. It was
great. And the higher we climbed, the better it
looked and the farther we could see, until the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
valley lay before us, all the way to Pittsfield and
west toward the Hudson. To the north, the Green
Mountains of Vermont looked blue in the distance.
Across the valley, on the south, old Greylock put
his head up above the other peaks and watched us,
wondering, we thought, why we were going up
Florida Mountain instead of climbing over him.</p>

<p>"Hurray!" yelled Skinny. "I'm Captain Clark,
exploring the great Northwest."</p>

<p>"I'm Captain Lewis," shouted Benny, strutting
around and waving his bow.</p>

<p>"Me Injun chief," said Bill. "Ugh! Heap
pale face get lost. No find trail. Injun show um
way."</p>

<p>Then he gave such a yell that it scared the horse
and we hardly could keep up.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the afternoon we came to
a spring near the top of the mountain, and a little
beyond, through the trees, we could see a grassy
slope, just the place for our camp.</p>

<p>"This looks good to me," said Mr. Norton, driving
up to the side of the road and blocking the
wheels of the wagon. "We'll give the horse a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
drink after he cools off a little and unload the
things which we shall need to-night."</p>

<p>It looked like an Indian village there, when we
had finished setting the tents up. For beds we
went into the woods and cut branches of hemlock,
which we wove into mattresses and covered with
blankets.</p>

<p>"Let's play 'Hunt the Deer,'" said Skinny,
when all was ready for the night and Mr. Norton
had sat down to rest on a rock, overlooking the
valley.</p>

<p>"All right, boys," he told us. "I want you to
have the time of your lives on this trip and I
know that even a view like this will not long
satisfy a boy. But don't go far and remember
your Scout training. You will usually find moss
on the north side of tree trunks."</p>

<p>"We know that," said Skinny. "We tried it
once on Greylock, when we were lost, and it worked
all right."</p>

<p>"You can't get lost. I believe I could hear
William call anywhere on the mountain. The sun
is shining and your shadows will point east. Come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
back in time for supper. I'll be cook to-night, but
after this you boys will have to take turns."</p>

<p>"We'll get back in time, never fear," Skinny told
him. "We are hungry enough now to gnaw the
bark off the trees."</p>

<p>Then he grabbed a bag which was stuffed with
hay, put an ear of corn in his pocket, and
started.</p>

<p>"Give me ten minutes," he said.</p>

<p>It was a game which we had read about in the
book. The stuffed bag was the deer and the corn
was for the trail. The game was for Skinny to
scatter corn along, making a crooked trail for us
to follow, and then to hide the deer somewhere for
us to find.</p>

<p>After Skinny had made a good start, we scattered,
looking for the trail&mdash;corn, footprints, and
other signs.</p>

<p>It was great fun and not easy for beginners
like we were. Sometimes we lost the trail altogether.
Then one of us would pick it up again,
where Skinny maybe had doubled back toward the
camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally Bill caught sight of the bag in some
bushes and yelled:</p>

<p>"Deer!"</p>

<p>Hank hurried up and called, "Second!" I saw
it third and all the boys soon after except Benny.
He had lost the trail and was beating around in
the woods somewhere, out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>It was Bill's first shot and he had to stand where
he was when he first saw the deer. He took out
an arrow, aimed carefully, and fired. The arrow
went so fast that I believe it almost would have
killed a real deer if it had hit him, but he aimed
too high and it went over.</p>

<p>Then Hank stepped five paces toward the deer
and shot. He missed. I stepped up five paces
more and I missed. Harry went five paces closer
and was the first to hit it. After that we all shot
from where he had stood, until we all had
hit it.</p>

<p>Skinny had come up and I was just asking him
if he had seen Benny, when we heard a great crashing
through the bushes and in a minute he came in
sight, running like sixty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>He was almost tuckered out when he reached us
and had only breath enough left to say:</p>

<p>"Run! It's a bear!"</p>

<p>We ran, all right, but after a little I looked
back and could see that there was nothing following.</p>

<p>"Hold up&mdash;a minute," I panted. "It&mdash;ain't a-comin'."</p>

<p>"Where was it, Benny?" I asked, when they had
come back. "Where did you see it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see it. I only heard it. It was stepping
around in the bushes and I heard it grunt. I
didn't wait to see it."</p>

<p>"I wish I had my rope," said Skinny. "I left
it in the wagon. Come on, anyhow. We'll surround
the critter and shoot him."</p>

<p>Skinny scared us when he said that. I could
feel cold chills chasing up and down my back bone,
when I thought of surrounding a live bear.</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" said Bill. "I hope it's a big
one, so Skinny can hit it. He couldn't hit a little
one."</p>

<p>"I couldn't, couldn't I?" said he. "I'll show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
you whether I can hit it or not. Come on. I'll
dare you to."</p>

<p>That settled it. We weren't going to take a dare,
but I was hoping all the time that the bear had
run away. So, with Benny keeping close to me
and pointing the way, we crept through the woods,
not making any noise, and each boy held his bow
and arrow ready to shoot.</p>

<p>It was scary but it was fun. Finally, with an
excited pinch of my arm, Benny stopped and
pointed.</p>

<p>My heart throbbed like a trip-hammer, and I
hardly could hold my arrow on the cord, for, looking
through some bushes, I caught sight of
something black and heard the bear tramping
around.</p>

<p>I heard Skinny muttering something about a
rope; then he whispered:</p>

<p>"Get ready, and run as soon as you shoot."</p>

<p>"Aim."</p>

<p>We stood there, trembling, wanting to run first
and shoot afterward, but too proud to. Each boy
pointed his arrow toward where we could see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
bear standing still behind some bushes and only
a part, of him showing.</p>

</div>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>I don't know when I fired. I only knew that
my arrow was gone and I was running for the
camp like the wind, with the other Scouts chasing
after me.</p>

<p>As we ran, we heard a yell of pain, or fright,
and it was not a bear's voice at all. It was a
woman's! Then we heard the voice say:</p>

<p>"For the love of Mike! The woods is full of
Injuns and I've got an arrow in the pit of my
stummick."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCOUTING THROUGH A WILDERNESS<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"FELLERS," said Skinny, panting and wetting
his lips with his tongue. "We've
done it this time. We've killed somebody."</div>

<p>"Killed nothin'!" Bill told him. "Didn't you
hear her holler?"</p>

<p>"She's running, too," said Benny. "Killed
folks don't run, especially girls."</p>

<p>We could hear a crashing through the bushes
beyond, and knew that what Benny said was true.</p>

<p>"Let's sneak back and get our arrows, anyhow,"
said Skinny, when the noise had stopped.</p>

<p>So we crept back again, ready to run if any one
should come, but there was nobody in sight. One
arrow was lying on the ground where the girl had
been standing when we took her for a bear. It
was Skinny's; we could tell by the way it was
painted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>It made him real chesty, after he had found
out that we had not killed anybody.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, Bill," said he, "that I'd show
you whether I could hit a bear or not? It must
have struck a button or something, or whoever it
was would have bit the dust, and don't you forget
it."</p>

<p>While we were standing there talking about it, a
man burst through the bushes, followed by a girl,
about eighteen years old, I guess.</p>

<p>"Are these your Injuns?" he asked, before we
had time to run. Then he burst out laughing in
such a way that we were not afraid to stay.</p>

<p>In a minute we had found out all about it. They
were fern gatherers and Benny had taken them for
bears. A lot of people go up on the mountain in
August, picking what they call Boston ferns to sell
to florists. They put them in cold storage and keep
them a long time. There is a crazy little railroad
at the foot of the mountain, on the east side, that
carries whole train loads of those ferns to Hoosac
Tunnel station, and afterward they are shipped all
over the country to be put in bouquets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Skinny's arrow had struck the girl and hurt her
a little, but not much. She was scared half to
death.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton had a fine supper ready when we
reached the camp again, and we ate until we
couldn't eat any longer.</p>

<p>"You boys ought to know what you are doing
every minute you are in the woods," he told us,
after he had heard about the scare. "Suppose that
Gabriel had been carrying a gun, as he wanted to,
instead of a bow and arrows. Just think what
would have happened. Hundreds of people have
been killed in exactly that way. Careless hunters
have mistaken them for bear or deer or some other
game. You ought to have known what you were
shooting at. It was a foolish thing to do, anyway.
I don't believe there can be any bears around where
so many people are looking for ferns and berries.
We'll see dozens of pickers on the other side of
the mountain, probably. If there ever were any
bears they have been frightened away long before
this. But suppose that had been a bear. For a
bunch of boys to attack a bear with bows and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
arrows isn't bravery. It is foolishness. I am
ashamed of you."</p>

<p>We didn't feel quite so chesty when Mr. Norton
had finished talking to us.</p>

<p>"Well, I am not going to spoil the day by scolding,"
he went on, after we'd had time to think
it over a little. "You can see the folly of it as
well as I. Let us sit here and watch the sun go
down behind the west mountains. Did you ever
see such glory? Then, when it grows dark, we'll
build a campfire and I'll tell you about a great
scout and a trip he once made through a wilderness."</p>

<p>It was fine sitting there, watching the sun sink
into a golden sea behind the mountains, while the
valley below was already in the shadow and the
dark was creeping up the hillsides.</p>

<p>We sat there a long time without speaking, until
finally the golden sea faded into a streak of gray,
and up and down the valley we could see the
twinkling lights of a half dozen towns and the
farmhouses between.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Norton threw an armful of brush on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the coals, and in the light of the blaze, which made
the shadows dance like ghosts of Indian braves, he
began his story.</p>

<p>"Some of you boys went out to Illinois, last
summer," said he, "and I know from what you
have told me that you learned much about the great
French scout, LaSalle; how he explored the Ohio
River and went up and down the Mississippi, taking
possession of the country in the name of the
king of France. We already have had one story
which grew out of those early explorations. The
Lewis and Clark Expedition through the Northwest,
which I told you about, can be traced back
to those scouting trips of LaSalle and the
others, on account of which France claimed the
country.</p>

<p>"This story is of another scouting trip, long
after LaSalle's time and before Lewis and Clark
were born, probably. It took place even before the
United States was born, but, in a way, it grew
out of those same trips of LaSalle and Tonty, Marquette
and Joliet, the French explorers of the seventeenth
century."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was this scout a Frenchman, then?" asked
Benny.</p>

<p>"No, he was of English parentage, one of the
finest English country gentlemen who ever lived,
but born in America, and one of the greatest American
scouts.</p>

<p>"He was a friend of yours, too, Skinny," he
added, laughing to himself.</p>

<p>"Not me," Skinny told him, shaking his head.
"I think a lot more of England than I did, on
account of General Baden-Powell and the Boy
Scout business, but I don't know this feller."</p>

<p>"That is strange. It seems to me that I have
heard you remark something about his being able
to lick Napoleon Bonaparte with one hand tied behind
his back."</p>

<p>"George Washington!" shouted Skinny. "The
Father of his Country. First in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, who's tellin' this story, anyhow?"
said Bill, pulling Skinny over and sitting on
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, George Washington, who, it seems to me,
would have made the finest kind of a Boy Scout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in his younger days&mdash;a scout worthy of membership
in Raven Patrol. He seems to have had all
of the Scout virtues. He was trustworthy, loyal
to his home and his native land; he was thrifty;
he was brave; he was reverent."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he couldn't bandage a broken leg like
we can," Benny told him.</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but he could find his way through
the forest and he didn't go around shooting at girls,
thinking that they were bears. He liked girls too
well for that. I believe he liked the girls better,
even, than our patrol leader does."</p>

<p>We set up a yell at that.</p>

<p>"Aw, I ain't stuck on no girls," said Skinny.
"I just rescue 'em, that's all."</p>

<p>"It's all right," Mr. Norton told him. "A girl
is the greatest thing in the world, unless it is a
boy. Anyhow, George Washington was a splendid
type of American boyhood and he surely liked the
girls; used to write poetry about them when he
was your age."</p>

<p>I don't know why, but somehow we seemed to
think more of Washington after we had heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that. It seemed to bring him closer to us and
make him a real person, instead of a picture on
the wall, praying at Valley Forge or crossing the
Delaware. Most always Washington is crossing
the Delaware when you see him.</p>

<p>"He was a big fellow in the first place, while
Napoleon was small. Size of body doesn't always
count. Some of the greatest men the world has
produced have been small of stature. But George
Washington was a big fellow. Like Lincoln, he
could outwrestle, outthrow, and outjump any of
his mates. They still show a spot down in Fredericksburg
where he stood and threw a stone across
the Rappahannock River. He didn't seem to know
the meaning of fear. From his early youth he
was a fine horseman, taming and riding horses
that nobody else could manage."</p>

<p>"Did his mother call him Georgie?" asked
Benny, before we could stop him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she did, although I hardly can imagine
it. At the age of fourteen George wanted to enter
the English navy and he came pretty near doing it.
If he had, perhaps he would have become a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
admiral instead of the father of his country. Who
knows?</p>

<p>"A midshipman's warrant was obtained for him,
so the story goes, and his clothes actually had been
sent aboard a man-of-war. Then, at the last minute,
his mother found that she could not give up
her oldest boy and she withdrew her consent. It
was a great disappointment to the boy, but like the
good Scout that he was he obeyed his mother and
went back to school. He learned to be a surveyor.</p>

<p>"Boys matured earlier in those days when the
country was new. When Washington was only
sixteen he set out on horseback through the Blue
Ridge Mountains on a surveying trip. A year
afterward he was given command of the militia in
a Virginia district, with the rank of major."</p>

<p>"I don't see what LaSalle had to do with all
that," said Harry.</p>

<p>"He didn't have anything to do with it, but
he had something to do with the scouting trip
which came later. You see, France and England
each had obtained a strong foothold in this country;
France, along the Great Lakes and Mississippi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
River; England, along the Atlantic Coast. Between
the Mississippi and the coast stretched a
beautiful and fertile country, the valley of the
Ohio. When LaSalle made his explorations he
took possession of the Mississippi in the name of
the king of France. On that account France
claimed to own all the land along the Mississippi
and along all the rivers which flowed into the Mississippi.
That took in a great part of the continent."</p>

<p>"I don't see how because LaSalle stood on a
rock and hollered out some words," Hank told
him, "that made the whole country belong to
France."</p>

<p>"England couldn't see it. Still, the English
claim was not much better. Commissioners from
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia made a
treaty with the Iroquois Indians in 1741. By the
terms of that treaty, for something like $2,000, the
Indians gave up all right and title to all the land
west of the Alleghany Mountains, clear to the Mississippi
River. There were all kinds of Indians
living in the Ohio Valley but, according to the traditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of the Iroquois Indians, their forefathers
once upon a time had conquered it."</p>

<p>"It looks like six of one and half a dozen of
the other," I said.</p>

<p>"There wasn't a white settlement in the whole
territory. Some hardy fur traders from Pennsylvania
had made trips into the valley and this led
to the formation of the Ohio Company of Virginia,
with the object of getting ahead of the
French and colonizing the lands. Then the French
began to get busy. France owned Canada at that
time, you know. In 1749 the French Governor
of Canada sent three hundred men to the banks
of the Ohio River with presents for the Indians.
They ordered the English traders out of the country
and nailed lead plates to trees, telling everybody
that the land belonged to France. The Indians
liked the presents well enough, but the lead plates
made them mad, when they found out their meaning.
One old chief exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'The French claim all the land on one side of
the Ohio; the English claim all the land on the
other. Now, where does the Indian land lie?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have gone into this explanation in order to
make it clear to you why Washington was sent on
his scouting trip. Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia
wanted to send some one whom he could trust to
the French commander, to protest against the
French coming into the country. At the same time,
he thought the messenger would be able to find out
how strong the French were, how many canoes
they had, and all that. It was a perilous mission
to undertake through an unknown wilderness, with
winter coming on. Young Washington was only
twenty-two years old, but he was selected as the
one to make the dangerous trip.</p>

<p>"Major Washington started from Williamsburg,
October 31, 1753. On the frontier he procured
horses, tents, etc. Later he was joined by a famous
woodsman, named Christopher Gist. They took
along a white man to act as interpreter and some
Indian guides. Chief White Thunder was one.
Another was known as the Half King. His friendship
was very important to the English.</p>

<p>"I imagine that the mountains which they went
through were much like these, except that rains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and snow had made them almost impassable. The
party pushed on, however, and early in December
arrived at the first French outpost. The French
captain gave a feast in their honor, in the course
of which he drank so much wine that it made him
talkative. He began to brag of what the French
were going to do. He said that they were going
to take possession of the entire Ohio Valley. The
young American scout kept his head clear and
afterward wrote down in a book all that he had
heard.</p>

<p>"Then Washington set out again, and after four
more days of weary travel they came to the French
fort on the west fork of French Creek, about fifteen
miles south of Lake Erie. There he delivered his
message, and after a great deal of delay received
a sealed reply.</p>

<p>"While pretending to be friendly, the French
did their best to win the Indian guides away from
Washington. They plied them with liquor and
with presents, so much so that the young scout
had a hard time in starting them toward home.
He succeeded finally in getting away. They first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
went up the creek in boats as far as an Indian
village, called Venango; then set out by land. Soon
their pack horses became so jaded that Washington
used his saddle horse for a pack horse and walked.
After three days of that, he and Gist took their
packs on their shoulders, their guns in their hands,
and started out alone, on a short cut to the Ohio
River.</p>

<p>"You will find the story in any history. At
one time a treacherous Indian guide wheeled suddenly
and shot at Washington, but did not hit him.
The two men quickly overpowered the savage, and
Gist was for killing him. Young Washington
would not permit that, so they did the next best
thing. They took his gun away and sent him
home, making him think that they would follow
in the morning. Instead of that, they left their
campfire burning and traveled all night and all the
next day, to get as far away from the spot as
possible. At last they reached the Alleghany River,
which they hoped to find frozen. There was open
water, however, and they were forced to build a
raft. All they had to work with was one hatchet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
like Skinny's, I mean Gabriel's. On the way
across, a cake of ice struck the raft and threw
Washington into the river."</p>

<p>"Gee, I'll bet that it was cold," said Skinny.</p>

<p>"It was, but Washington clung to the raft and
finally, in a half-frozen condition, drifted against
an island, where the two men camped that night.
In the morning they found ice cakes so wedged in
that they were able to walk ashore.</p>

<p>"January 16, in the dead of winter, Washington
succeeded in reaching Williamsburg, and delivered
the French commander's letter to Governor
Dinwiddie. Soon after that came the French and
Indian war, which I am sure you know all about,
in which France lost all her American possessions
except the great tract west of the Mississippi, which
Napoleon later sold to President Jefferson.</p>

<p>"You see, being a scout in those days wasn't
all play. It brought many hardships that we know
little about, but, after all, it called for the same
kind of boy. Washington was brave and true,
helpful, kind, and clean, and he was prepared.
When the time came, his preparedness put him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
command of the American forces and afterward
made him the first President of the United States."</p>

<p>"Washington was great stuff, all right," said
Skinny, shaking his head sadly, "but everything has
been discovered now, and explored, and Injuns ain't
much good outside a show. There ain't anything
for a feller to do any more."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON HISTORIC GROUND<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WE were one more night on the road before
reaching the Connecticut River.</div>

<p>"This trip is going to be a great part of the
fun," Mr. Norton had told us, "and the best part
of it is that we can go as slowly or as fast as we
please. We'll cross over the mountain to-day,
stopping whenever we feel like it, and go into
camp somewhere on the other side. I want to
have you do some of our Scout stunts on the
way."</p>

<p>I don't know which was the most fun, walking
along the mountain road, which wound through
green woods and across laughing brooks, or pitching
our camp at night and, after a good supper of
our own cooking, listening to Mr. Norton's stories,
around the campfire.</p>

<p>We started bright and early in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
carrying only our bows and arrows and Skinny's
hatchet. The other things were on the wagon.
Mr. Norton drove because we boys wanted to play.</p>

<p>Skinny was George Washington, making his way
through the wilderness. He carried the hatchet
because he might have to build a raft to get across
Deerfield River. Benny was bound to be Christopher
Gist. Bill had a right to first choice, on
account of being corporal, but Benny wanted to be
Gist and Bill didn't care. He said he'd rather be
White Thunder, anyhow; it sounded so nice and
noisy. Hank said that he'd be the Half King, whatever
that was.</p>

<p>"His name was Tanacharisson," said Mr. Norton.
"He was a Seneca chief of great note in
those days. He was called 'Half King' because he
wasn't a whole king. He was under the chief of
the Six Nations."</p>

<p>I don't know what the rest of us were, but I
do know that we had a fine time, scouting through
the forest and along the road. When we came to
the town of Florida, on top of the mountain,
Skinny told us that it was the Indian village of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Venango, where we'd find the French outposts.
He wanted to surround it, but White Thunder was
for pushing on because he was getting hungry, although
it was still quite early in the forenoon.</p>

<p>So we trudged along, and down the mountain
road on the other side, until we came to Deerfield
River.</p>

<p>We found a bridge across the river and didn't
have to make a raft. There wasn't water enough
to float one over the rocks, anyhow, although there
was more than usual on account of the big rain.</p>

<p>By night we had left the Florida Mountain far
behind. Along in the afternoon of the next day
we marched into Deerfield, which is on the Connecticut
River. Say, the people came out of their
houses to see us pass, with our uniforms on and
Skinny in front, swinging his rope and hatchet.</p>

<p>"This is historic ground," Mr. Norton told us.
"At the campfire to-night we'll have a story of
some fights with Indians which were the real
thing. They ought to make your hair stand on
end. That stream over there got its name 'Bloody
Brook' from one of those fights."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>We camped that night on the bank of Connecticut
River, and it seemed a long way from home.</p>

<p>"This river was discovered by the Dutch," said
Mr. Norton, after we had eaten a big supper and
were lying on the river bank in the twilight of the
evening, tired and happy. "The permanent settlements,
however, were made by the English. The
river was explored by a Hollander six years before
Gabriel's English ancestors came over in the <i>Mayflower</i>.
The first English settlements, you know,
were made along the Atlantic coast. Some years
later a few of those settlers hiked over to the Connecticut
Valley, or came up the river, and started
a number of towns. One of them was Deerfield.</p>

<p>"It is hard for us to imagine this fertile and
cultivated valley in a wild state, with a few white
settlers here and there surrounded by Indians. The
whites considered themselves a superior race and
probably showed it by their actions. Gradually the
savages, who at first had been kind, grew more
sullen and dangerous. This growing hatred on the
part of the Indians made it very difficult for the
settlers, but there was another thing which made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
it harder. In Europe, two great nations, England
and France, were in almost constant warfare, and
each was striving to get the better of the other in
the settlement and possession of America.</p>

<p>"There were some early Indian wars, with which
the French did not have anything to do, but they
had much to do with the later wars and attacks
by Indians. One of those early struggles is known
as King Philip's war, named after a wily Indian
chief. It occurred just one hundred years before
the Revolution, where our patrol leader lost his ancestor.
Even at that early day there were one
hundred and twenty-five people in Deerfield. In
that war the Indians attacked the town twice."</p>

<p>"Was that what made the brook bloody?"
asked Benny.</p>

<p>"No. The bloody event which gave the brook
its name happened during the same war but not
during an attack on the town itself. September 18,
1675, I believe, was the date. A company of young
men, commanded by Captain Lothrup, marched out
of the town and along a road leading toward the
brook. They were acting as guard and teamsters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for a number of loaded carts, which were being
taken to some settler's home. It was a beautiful
day and everything seemed as peaceful as it does
now. All were happy and there was no thought
of danger. Some had even placed their guns in
the carts and were walking unarmed.</p>

<p>"At the brook a band of Indian warriors lay
in ambush, waiting. On came the young men,
laughing and whistling and chatting with one another.
They stopped occasionally to gather some
wild grapes, which grew along the way. Concealed
in the long grass, on each side of the road, lay
the painted savages, motionless and unseen. Their
eyes gleamed with hatred and exultation as they
watched their victims approach. Their eager hands
tightly grasped their weapons. Impatient for the
slaughter to begin, they awaited the signal."</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" whispered Bill.</p>

<p>"Snakes is the word. Like snakes in the grass
they lay, as silent as the grave. At last the signal
was given. With fierce cries they sprang upon the
surprised whites, and the little brook ran red with
blood. Sixty-four men in all, from the various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
settlements, were killed that day. Of seventeen
young men, who went out from Deerfield that
morning, not one returned.</p>

<p>"Too late, another company of men came to the
rescue. They found nobody left to rescue. The
Indians then were plundering the wagons. The
savages outnumbered the rescuing party ten to one,
but the little band did not hesitate. They fought
desperately for five or six hours. They were unable
to drive the savages away, however, and were
just going to retreat, when some soldiers from
Northampton, down the river, appeared and put
the Indians to flight. There was sadness in Deerfield
that day."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I want to play Indian any more,"
said Benny, drawing closer to the fire and looking
around as if he might see some savages hiding in
the grass. It made us all feel scary.</p>

<p>"We hardly can imagine it now," Mr. Norton
went on, "after more than two hundred years.
Later there were other wars and many attacks by
Indians. The Deerfield people built a stockaded
fort, into which all would run at the first alarm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
These later attacks by the savages were a part of
the fight between England and France for the possession
of America. The French induced the Indians
to help them drive the English out, but Englishmen
do not drive worth a cent, and at last, as
you know, France was obliged to give up Canada
to England, in whose possession it has remained
ever since.</p>

<p>"First came King William's war, in which Deerfield
was attacked several times; then Queen Anne's
war, and during that the town was captured and
a great part of it burned."</p>

<p>"Tell us about that," I said.</p>

<p>"War is always a terrible thing, but in those
days it seems to have been more than usually savage
and cruel. Take the capture of Deerfield, for example.
The French commander in Canada sent
three hundred soldiers to butcher the people in this
little town, in order to make himself solid with
some Indians. The attack occurred a little before
daybreak, and some terrible scenes were enacted.
I'll show you an old door up in Memorial Hall
to-morrow, which went through that fight. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
so solid that they could not break it down. You
will see where a hole was cut through it with axes
and bullets.</p>

<p>"That massacre occurred February 29, 1704,
about two hundred years ago. Then came other
French and Indian conflicts, until finally England
triumphed. Later the United States Nation was
born, and President Jefferson bought all of the
American territory that France had left.</p>

<p>"Everything is peaceful here now, but think how
you would feel, to know that you might be surrounded
by savages, fierce and bloodthirsty, creeping
toward you in the darkness, without a sound,
until near enough to strike, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All of a sudden there came some awful yells and
whoops that made our blood run cold, and a
crashing in the bushes that sounded as if all kinds
of Indians were after us.</p>

<p>We jumped to our feet and looked, even Mr.
Norton. Benny grabbed tight hold of my hand,
and I could see Skinny feeling around in the grass
for his hatchet.</p>

<p>Then it came again, nearer than before, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
worse and over to one side. It was awful. I don't
know about Mr. Norton, but the rest of us were
just going to run, when the yell ended with three
caws, like a crow in the Bellows Pipe at home.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Skinny, in disgust. "It's only
Bill Wilson!"</p>

<p>We camped there on the river bank nearly a
week and never had more fun in our lives, boating,
fishing, swimming, doing Scout stunts and playing
Scout games, and, with it all, eating our heads
off, almost.</p>

<p>I can't remember every little thing that we did
there, and the boys say that it will be all right
to skip that part in writing this history. There
didn't anything much happen, anyhow, although
Mrs. Wade was sure some of us would get drowned
and even Ma told us that she would not feel
real easy in her mind until we were at home
again.</p>

<p>"We'll go a little earlier than we intended," said
Mr. Norton, when it was getting near the time for
going back. "I want to see some more of that
beautiful Deerfield valley, before the river leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the mountains. Perhaps we might do a little exploring
on our own account."</p>

<p>We came in sight of Florida Mountain on our
homeward trip, not far from Hoosac Tunnel. The
longest part was behind us, but the hardest part, the
climb over the mountain, was ahead.</p>

<p>Wild? Say, if you want to see a wild country,
follow Deerfield River as it fights its way down
from Vermont, until finally it breaks through the
mountains and runs off to join the Connecticut.
When you get in among those mountains you will
think that you are Christopher Columbus discovering
America.</p>

<p>"The Rockies are higher," said Skinny, when
we had stopped to rest and look around a little.
"I read it in a book. Besides, Mr. Norton told us
about Lewis and Clark climbing over them. But
these are some mountains all right; believe me."</p>

<p>That was what we all thought. They were all
tumbled and jumbled together in a topsy-turvy way,
with the river winding around in every direction,
trying to get through, and the railroad following
the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Norton pointed it out to us and stood there
with his hat in his hand, looking. His eyes were
shining, and red was coming into his cheeks, as if
he was seeing something which we boys couldn't
see at all. And maybe he was, for I have noticed
that grown folks sometimes can't see and hear the
things which we boys see and hear; at any rate,
not in the same way.</p>

<p>"What does it make you think of?" he asked
each of us.</p>

<p>Benny's answer was the best of all.</p>

<p>"There was once a baseball nine made up of
real giants," said he. "They were so big that their
heads reached clear up into the sky. One day when
they were practising they lost the ball and so they
picked up these 'ere mountains and began to throw
them to each other, playing catch. Every once in
a while some guy would muff the ball, I mean
the mountain. Then he would let it lie where
it had fallen and pick up another. That is
why they are all tumbled together every which
way."</p>

<p>"That's so," I said. "You can see where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
dirt jarred off when they fell, leaving the bare
rocks sticking out in a lot of places."</p>

<p>"It's alive, boys," said Bill, who had been feeling
of Benny's head and looking anxious. "It feels
like a nut, but it ain't cracked."</p>

<p>"Benny has given us a good description and
something to think about," said Mr. Norton. "I
don't believe that I should like to live here all the
time, but I should enjoy staying a week and drinking
in all this beauty. Talk about music! Hear
the mountain breeze in the treetops. What does it
remind you of, Gabriel?"</p>

<p>"It sounds to me exactly like beefsteak frying,"
Skinny told him, "and it makes me hungry. Let's
have some eats."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mr. Norton, laughing to himself.
"Now that you mention it, I believe that I
can detect a faint resemblance. We can't give you
beefsteak, but there is some bacon left and that
ought to make much the same kind of noise. Whose
turn is it to cook?"</p>

<p>"It's mine," Hank told him.</p>

<p>"Well, get busy, and for fear that we might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
disturb you, we'll go off somewhere and sit in the
shade."</p>

<p>We were all as hungry as wolves when Hank
at last called us to dinner and it tasted fine, although
my piece was burnt a little.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you boys feel about it," said
Mr. Norton, after the dishes had been washed and
put away, "but I should like to camp here for a
couple of days. We'll do just as you say, however.
Perhaps you have had enough."</p>

<p>We all had been thinking the same thing and
told him so.</p>

<p>"All right. We'll find a good place for our tents
and go into camp. It will give us a chance to
wash out some clothes in the river and to explore
this delightful wilderness."</p>

<p>We had all kinds of fun practising our Scout
stunts, exploring, playing Indian, and things like
that. One of the prettiest places that we found
was a ravine, where two cascades, twins, tumbled
over rocky ledges; then came together and raced
down the mountain. I don't mean that they were
as pretty as Peck's Falls, above our cave. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
don't make any finer places than that, only, of
course, Niagara Falls are bigger. But they were
worth looking at, just the same.</p>

<p>I am going to put down just how to get there, in
case somebody should want to see them. You
probably wouldn't walk over the mountain, as we
did, because it takes so much time, but would go
through Hoosac Tunnel. After you have gone
through from the North Adams side and the train
stops to take off the electric engine and put a steam
one on, get off and walk back to the mouth of the
tunnel. Then, when you have come to the mountain,
climb up a sort of path, following the brook,
and after a little you will come to the twin cascades.
We thought of camping there at first, but
couldn't find any good place for our tents.</p>

<p>Except for the train passing and the engineer
leaning out of the cab window, we seemed out of
the world, although we were not more than ten
miles from home, in a straight line. The train
was like company, and when we were around near
we always watched it out of sight.</p>

<p>That is a queer little railroad which comes down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
from Wilmington and Readsboro, Vermont, as far
as Hoosac Tunnel station. Mr. Norton told us
all about it. It is what they call a narrow gauge
railroad. That means that the rails are closer together
than on most railroads, and on that account
regular cars cannot run on it. Its rails are three
and a half feet apart, while on a regular railroad
they are four feet, eight and one-half inches apart.
It runs along one bank of Deerfield River, a few
feet above the water. The river is mostly stones
in summer, with water in between.</p>

<p>The day after we camped there Skinny, Bill,
Benny, Hank, and I sat on a big stone, opposite our
camp, waiting to see the train go by. The other
boys had gone with Mr. Norton part way up the
mountain, looking for berries for our supper.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the train came in sight from toward
Readsboro, fifteen miles north, and it was swinging
along at good speed, for it was downhill.</p>

<p>We cheered and waved our hats as it went by.
I noticed a girl, who was sitting at one of the
windows in the passenger car, give a look of surprise
when she saw us; then she leaned far out and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
waved her handkerchief. It wasn't anybody that I
knew, but when Skinny saw her he jumped to his
feet and let out a yell. And what he said was:</p>

<p>"Mary!"</p>

<p>It surprised us some. You may not believe it,
but the girl was Mary Richmond, the one Skinny
walked down the mountain with, that time he lassoed
the bear, when he was doing his hike to Savoy
and back. She had been up to Readsboro with her
mother, visiting.</p>

<p>"Come on," said he, starting on a run. "She'll
have to change cars at Hoosac Tunnel station."</p>

<p>"Aw, what's the use?" said Bill. "We don't
know her."</p>

<p>At that instant, while we stood there watching,
we saw the engine give a sudden lurch and then
go bumping over the ties. In another moment it
struck a rock or something and, with an awful
crash, the whole train went off the embankment
into the river below.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>YOU may have heard of that wreck, for the
papers printed a lot about it at the time.</div>

<p>After the first crash, there was not a sound.
I don't know how long we stood there, paralyzed
with horror, staring at the place where the train
had been. Then we heard a shriek of fear, or
pain, we couldn't tell which, and it was a girl's
voice.</p>

<p>That shriek brought us to our senses.</p>

<p>"Scouts to the rescue!"</p>

<p>Skinny shouted at the top of his voice, hoping
that Mr. Norton and the others would hear, and
we started on a run.</p>

<p>Before we had gone halfway Skinny turned to
Benny.</p>

<p>"Run back to the camp," said he. "Get the
bandages and other first-aid things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"And bring my rope and hatchet," he called,
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The awful stillness after that first shriek sent
us on faster than ever, while something seemed to
clutch at our throats so that we hardly could
breathe.</p>

<p>Bill got there first, but we were not far behind.
When we had come close we could see the train,
lying on the stones in the river bed. The engine
had turned bottom side up and lay there on its
back with its wheels in air. The passenger car
was on its side and was so badly smashed that it
didn't look like a car at all.</p>

<p>"We've got to have help and have it quick," said
Skinny, looking almost pale. "Who'll go to
Hoosac Tunnel station for help? Hank, you go,
and run like Sam Hill."</p>

<p>Hank was off like a deer before the words were
out of his mouth, running toward the station, nearly
two miles away.</p>

<p>"Mary!" called Skinny. "Mary! Where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Here," we heard a faint voice say. And,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
climbing down, we found her, wedged in between
some timbers so that she could not move.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" we asked, as we commenced
to pry her loose.</p>

<p>"A little," she told us, beginning to cry. "I
don't know how much, but I'm all right for now.
Find mamma. I don't know where she is."</p>

<p>After a little search we found her, nearly covered
with timbers and bleeding from a cut in her head.</p>

<p>"She's dead," I whispered, while an awful feeling
came over me. Her eyes were closed and she
didn't move, even after we had lifted the timbers
away.</p>

<p>We dragged her out as gently as we could and
laid her on a couple of car seats which we took
from the train. I sprinkled some water in her face
and pretty soon she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>She stared around for a second or two, trying
to understand where she was. Then she saw
Skinny and seemed to remember.</p>

<p>"Mary!" said she. "Have you seen Mary?
Oh, save my little girl!"</p>

<p>"Mary's all right," Skinny told her. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
haven't got her out yet, but we know just where
she is. She sent us to find you."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she whispered, and then she
fainted again.</p>

<p>We left her there, lying among the stones on the
river bottom, with her dress floating in the water.</p>

<p>"I wish Mr. Norton was here," groaned Skinny.
"I don't know what to do. Here comes Benny
with the things."</p>

<p>There wasn't any time to talk. We hurried back
to where we could see Mary's head sticking out of
the wreck. She had her eyes closed, and I thought
she had fainted, but she heard us come up and
opened them.</p>

<p>"We've got your mother out," Skinny said.
"Now we'll get you out."</p>

<p>Her eyes asked the question which her lips
couldn't seem to do.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's alive," we told her. "She's got
an ugly cut on her head, but she seems all right
except that."</p>

<p>It was all we could do to get her out, the timbers
were so heavy and so wedged in. They had fallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
across each other and made sort of a roof over
her. If it hadn't been for that she would have been
killed. By all pulling on the rope and cutting some
with the hatchet, we finally managed to get her
loose.</p>

<p>When we started to lift her out she screamed
with pain. We kept on lifting. There was no
other way.</p>

<p>"It's my foot," she moaned. "It feels as if it
was all broken to pieces."</p>

<p>Two of us made a chair with our hands and
carried her carefully up on the river bank; then
hurried back to the wreck.</p>

<p>"There is a man groaning somewhere," said
Bill. "I think it must be the conductor."</p>

<p>We found him lying under some wreckage and
in great pain.</p>

<p>"Where are you hurt?" we asked, when we had
lifted the wreck off from him.</p>

<p>"My leg!" he groaned. "It's broken. I'm all
in."</p>

<p>I took out my knife and ripped his trouser leg
and underclothes to above the spot that hurt him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a little above the knee. Then, by putting one hand
above the break and the other below it, just as Mr.
Norton had made us practise doing a lot of times,
and lifting very gently I could see the broken bone
move. He ground his teeth together and great
drops of sweat came out on his forehead, it hurt
him so much, although I was trying to be careful.</p>

<p>"It's broken, all right," I told him. "We've
sent for help. The only thing to do is to lie still
and wait."</p>

<p>We straightened him out and piled some coats
and things, which we found in the wreck, around
his leg, to make him as comfortable as we could.</p>

<p>"How many are there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I only had two passengers, a woman and a
little girl. They got on at Readsboro. Then there
was the engineer, fireman, and brakeman, besides
myself. We run only a small crew on this train."</p>

<p>The brakeman came up while he was speaking.
He had been stunned at first and when he came to
had managed to crawl out.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Jim or George?" he asked.</p>

<p>The conductor shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you boys know anything about the engineer
and fireman?"</p>

<p>We hadn't thought of them before. We had
been too busy.</p>

<p>"Then they are under the engine," said he.</p>

<p>He ran through the river to the head of the train,
we after him, almost crazy with the thought of
those men at the bottom of that awful heap of iron
and steel. We pulled and lifted at the great pieces,
but we might just as well have tried to move the
mountain.</p>

<p>"We can't do it, boys," the brakeman said, at
last. "We'll have to wait for help. There isn't
one chance in a hundred that they are alive, but
they may be. Somebody will have to run to the
station and make sure that they bring some jacks.
I am 'most done up and don't feel equal to it.
Which one of you will go? Only one, now; the
others will be needed here."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Benny. "I'm the littlest one in
the bunch and can be spared the easiest. What
was that you said you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Jacks; to jack up the engine frame with. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
are several in the baggage room. I saw them
there."</p>

<p>Benny hated to leave, when there was so much
going on, but before the brakeman had finished
speaking he was climbing up on the river bank.
In another second he had started down the track
on a run.</p>

<p>"Now, fellers," Skinny told us, trying to keep
his teeth from chattering, he was so excited, "our
Scout book says for us to keep cool and we've
got to do it. While we are waiting for help the
thing for us to do is to be Scouts and to get busy
with our bandages."</p>

<p>"And make some stretchers," added Bill. "We
can't use our coats and hike sticks, like the book
says, because we didn't bring 'em."</p>

<p>"That's easy. We can use car seats."</p>

<p>The "first-aid kits," which Benny had brought
from camp, had everything that we needed. That
was what they were put up for, only we didn't think
we should need them. There were shears and
tweezers, carbolized vaseline, sterilized dressings for
wounds, to keep the germs out, all kinds of bandages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and things like that. Say, we looked like a
drug store when we had fairly started.</p>

<p>Skinny cut away the shoe from Mary's foot and
Bill brought cold water from a nearby spring, to
bathe it in. The foot was bruised and the ankle
sprained, but no bones were broken. Soon they
had her feeling better.</p>

<p>I went to help Mrs. Richmond, but all the time
I was thinking of the men under the engine. She
was sitting up on the car seat, trying to keep her
feet out of the water.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt anywhere else, except your
head?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I have had a bad shock and
my head is cut, but I can move all my limbs; so I
guess there are no broken bones."</p>

<p>Her head looked worse than it was, with a gash
cut in it and her hair matted down with blood.</p>

<p>"I don't dare bathe the cut," I told her, "because
the water may be full of germs, and besides I
haven't anything to bathe it with. The book says
to be careful about that."</p>

<p>"What does the book say about my washing my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
face?" said she, and she didn't wait for an
answer.</p>

<p>It didn't take long to put on a sterilized dressing
and bandage her up in good shape. Then, with
Skinny on one side and I on the other, she managed
to walk to a low place on the river bank,
where Mary was waiting, and climb up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richmond said so much about how we had
saved her and her little girl, it made us feel foolish.</p>

<p>"That ain't anything," Skinny told her. "That's
what Scouts are for."</p>

<p>"It may be a long time before a doctor gets
here," I said, after a little. "He will have to come
from North Adams or Readsboro. And that conductor
is getting worse every minute. If you will
help me, Skinny, I'll try to put splints on his
leg."</p>

<p>You see, I had practised with the splints more
than some of the boys had. They were all for saving
folks from drowning.</p>

<p>We first found two pieces of board. There were
plenty of them scattered around, on account of the
wreck. We put one piece, which was long enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to reach from his armpit to below his foot, on the
outside of the leg. The other we put on the inside.
It didn't have to be so long, but reached well below
the knee. Then, making sure the broken bones
were in place, we tied the splints on with strips
from Skinny's shirt, first putting a cushion of leaves
between the boards and the leg. After that we tore
up Bill's shirt and tied the broken leg to the good
one with three or four strips of that.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that we can get him up on the
river bank?" asked Skinny, when we had him all
fixed.</p>

<p>"We must," a quiet voice answered.</p>

<p>Turning, we saw Mr. Norton, who had come up
so still that we had not heard him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Norton!" cried Skinny. "We are so
glad you have come. It is an awful wreck and
nobody to do anything at first but us, and we didn't
know what to do. I think the engineer and fireman
were killed. The brakeman is over there, trying
to get them out."</p>

<p>"You seem to have done remarkably well for
boys who didn't know what to do. I want two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
poles from the woods, Gabriel. Quick! William,
you go with him. John will help me here."</p>

<p>Skinny grabbed his hatchet, and before we had
time to miss them the boys were back again with
two long poles. While they were away Mr. Norton
and I pulled two car seats out of the wreck
and were ready to make a stretcher. By laying
the seats end to end on the poles and tying them
fast with Skinny's rope, we had a good one and
not bad to ride on, because of the springs.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Norton and the brakeman, with us
boys helping all we could, lifted the conductor very
carefully and laid him on the stretcher. To lift
it by the ends of the poles and carry it up to the
river bank was the easiest part of all.</p>

<p>By that time, Hank and Benny had come back
with two or three men from Hoosac Tunnel station,
and they went to work with jacks to get the
engineer and fireman out.</p>

<p>"A special train is coming from Readsboro,"
Hank told us. "It's bringing some doctors and
the wrecker."</p>

<p>"Do you feel able to continue your journey, Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Richmond?" Mr. Norton asked. "We could manage
to carry the little girl as far as the station and
there is a train due from North Adams in about
an hour. Or would you rather wait for the special
and go back?"</p>

<p>"I think we'd better go back to Readsboro," she
said. "We have friends there and I don't feel
much like walking."</p>

<p>We didn't have long to wait, for the train soon
came puffing down the valley. Two doctors jumped
off before it had time to stop and hurried over to
where we were standing. They were surprised
some, when they saw the people all bandaged
up.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" asked one of them, standing
over the conductor. "I thought there were no
surgeons here. Did you succeed in getting somebody
from North Adams?"</p>

<p>"These boys," Mr. Norton told him. "They
are Boy Scouts and have been in training some time
for this very job."</p>

<p>The doctor gave a little whistle.</p>

<p>"Good thing for him," he said, "that they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
around. I couldn't have done it much better,
myself."</p>

<p>We felt proud when he said that, and I could
tell by the way Mr. Norton smiled at us that he
was feeling pretty good over it.</p>

<p>All the same, the doctor bandaged him over again,
to make sure that everything was all right. When
he had finished, the hurt ones were put on board
the train and made as comfortable as possible. We
heard some cheering over by the wreck and hurried
back to find out what had happened.</p>

<p>"They are alive," a man explained. "We've
jacked her up a little, and the engineer just spoke
to us. He says that the fireman is alive, too."</p>

<p>It made us feel better to know that they were
alive, and the men worked like sixty to get them
out. By that time the wrecking crew had the big
crane ready. After that it was easy. It didn't
take long to swing the heavy frame clear of the
ground and to one side.</p>

<p>The two men were found somewhere in the mass,
badly hurt but alive, which was more than we could
understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>They were lifted out as carefully as possible and
carried to the car.</p>

<p>"Good-by, boys!" called Mary out of the window.</p>

<p>"Good-by! God bless you, dear children!" said
Mrs. Richmond.</p>

<p>"Good-by,&mdash;good-by," yelled the brakeman.</p>

<p>The doctors were too busy to say good-by to
anybody. We watched the train steam up through
the valley; then Mr. Norton took each one of us by
the hand, and he squeezed hard.</p>

<p>We heard afterward that both men got well, although
many weeks passed before they were able
to work again.</p>

<p>We started for home, bright and early the next
morning, taking all day for the climb over the
mountain and camping that night among the foothills
on the west side. It was only six or seven
miles from there home, and we were so tough and
hard that it didn't seem far.</p>

<p>"We can do it in two hours, easy," said Skinny.</p>

<p>We were beginning to be in a hurry to see our
folks and the cave, after being away so long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's get home in time for breakfast," I said.
"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"And go without eatin' until we get there? Not
much!"</p>

<p>"We can have an early breakfast," Mr. Norton
told us, "and start as soon as we can see; say,
about four o'clock. We ought to be able to make
it by seven, easily, and I feel sure that we shall
be able to eat again, after our walk. I'd like to
get home early, myself. It is time that I was
going back to work after my vacation."</p>

<p>That is what we did, and we surprised everybody.
They had not been expecting us before afternoon.</p>

<p>After that we didn't see anything of Mr. Norton
for several days. Then he asked us to meet
him at a campfire on Bob's Hill, Saturday evening.</p>

<p>"I have spoken to your parents," he told us,
"and they have arranged for a picnic in Plunkett's
woods, Saturday afternoon. We will eat supper
together on the grass, at the edge of the woods, and
afterward have a campfire at the old stone. I think
that we owe it to your people to make a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
official report of what we did on our trip; that will
be a good time to do it."</p>

<p>That was some picnic, all right, and it was great
fun, sitting there, talking and eating; then playing
Indian in the woods, surrounding the palefaces,
and all that. But, best of all, was the campfire,
after the sun had gone down and the moon lighted
up the hills and made old Greylock loom up big and
shadowy. Of course, we had told our folks all
about everything but they wanted to hear more, and
we had to tell it all over again.</p>

<p>Finally Pa spoke up. "We have heard a great
deal from the Scouts," he said, "and we have enjoyed
it all. Now, we'd like to hear from the
Scoutmaster, how the boys behaved. But first I
want to tell him how grateful we all feel for what
he is doing for these youngsters."</p>

<p>"I am enjoying it as much as they are," said
Mr. Norton, looking fine as he stood there, with
the moonlight on his face. "In fact, I think that
I am getting more out of it than they are. I asked
you fathers and mothers to meet me here to-night
because I wanted to tell you how proud I am of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
these Bob's Hill boys, the Boy Scouts of Raven
Patrol. I understand that in their cave at Peck's
Falls they have a motto hanging, which says that
'The Boys of Bob's Hill are going to make good.'
They have made good, Mr. Smith, every one of
them."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment; then went on:</p>

<p>"I have made official application for Honor
Medals for the part they took in saving human life
at that unfortunate train wreck, and I hope the
National Court of Honor will award them. But I,
myself, have wanted to do something personally to
show the boys how much I have enjoyed their
companionship and what I think of their conduct&mdash;all
of them, not only those who happened to be
on hand at the time of the wreck. So I have had
this banner made to hang under the other one, in
the cave, or wherever their place of meeting may
be."</p>

<p>He pulled out a fine silk banner from his pocket,
as he spoke, and shook it out until it hung full
length in the moonlight, and, looking, we saw in
one corner a black raven and "Patrol 1, Troop 3<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Mass."; then, in large, gold letters, the Scout
motto:</p>

<div class='center'>
"BE PREPARED."<br />
</div>

<p>How we did cheer! And our folks cheered
louder than anybody.</p>

<p>"Guess what!" said Benny, after all was still
again. "When we grow up, we are going to try
and be like Mr. Norton, our Scoutmaster."</p>

<p>"Bet your life we are!" shouted Skinny, springing
to his feet and waving the banner.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and stood there, looking at us,
with his arms folded.</p>

<p>"I have spoken," said he. "Let be what is."</p>
